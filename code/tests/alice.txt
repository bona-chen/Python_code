第一章
放下兔子的洞


爱丽丝开始厌倦她的姐姐坐在
银行，无事可做：她曾经窥探过一两次
她姐姐正在读书的书，但没有照片或
爱丽丝想，其中的对话“以及书的用途是什么”
“没有图片或对话吗？”

因此，她正在考虑自己的想法（尽可能）
炎热的日子使她感到非常困倦和愚蠢），
制作一条雏菊链值得起床的麻烦，
采摘雏菊时，突然有一只粉红色眼睛的白兔子跑了
在她附近。

没有什么特别的了。爱丽丝也不认为
所以，很不容易听到兔子对自己说：
亲！噢亲爱的！我会迟到！” （当她后来考虑过时，
她想到她应该对此感到惊讶，但是在
时间似乎很自然）；但是当兔子实际上_
从背心口袋里拿出来，看着它，然后匆匆忙忙
继续，爱丽丝开始站起来，因为它闪过她的脑海，
从来没有见过有背心口袋或兔子的兔子
看着把它拿出来，好奇地燃烧着，她跑过
字段之后，幸运的是正好及时看到它弹出
树篱下有个大兔子洞。

再过一会儿，爱丽丝紧追不舍
在世界上，她要再次走出去。

兔子洞像隧道一样一直往前走，然后
突然下降，以至于爱丽丝没有时间思考
在发现自己跌倒之前停下来
深井。

井是很深，还是跌得很慢，因为
当她下楼去看看她并想知道什么时，有很多时间
接下来会发生。首先，她试图往下看
她要去的是什么，但天色太暗，看不到任何东西；然后她
看着井壁，发现它们充满了
橱柜和书架；她在这里和那里看到地图和图片
挂在钉子上。她从一个架子上取下一个罐子，
通过 它被贴上了“橘子果酱”的标签，但对她来说很棒
令人失望的是，它是空的：她不喜欢因为害怕而掉下罐子
杀死下面的人，所以设法将其放入其中之一
她掉下来的橱柜。

“好！” 爱丽丝心想，“经过这样的跌倒，我将
别想下楼梯了！他们都会认为我多么勇敢
在家！为什么，即使我摔倒了，我也不会说什么
房子的顶部！” （很可能是真的。）

下来，下来，下来。_never_的秋天会结束吗？“我想知道如何
这次我跌了很多英里？” 她大声说。“我必须
到达地球中心附近的某个地方。让我看看：
我认为要下降四千英里-”（因为，爱丽丝已经学会了
她在教室里的课上有几件事，
虽然这不是炫耀她的良机
知识，因为没有人听她的话，但这仍然很好
练习说出来））“-是的，那是正确的距离-但是
然后我想知道我要去的纬度或经度？” （爱丽丝没有
知道纬度是什么，或者是经度，但是认为它们很好
好话要说。）

现在她又开始了。“我想知道我是否会正确无误
地球！走路的人似乎会觉得这很有趣
头朝下！我认为，“反感”
很高兴，这次没有人听，因为它根本没声音
正确的词）“-但我必须问他们
国家是，你知道。夫人，请问，这是新西兰还是澳大利亚？”
（而且她在讲话时尝试行小调-想当年_curtseying_
掉到空中！您认为您可以管理吗？）
一个无知的小女孩，她会以为我要的！不，永远不会
问：也许我会看到它写在某个地方。”

下来，下来，下来。没有其他事情可以做，所以爱丽丝很快就开始了
再说一次。“迪纳今晚会非常想念我，我想！”
（黛娜是那只猫。）“我希望他们能记得她的牛奶碟。
下午茶时间。亲爱的黛娜！我希望你和我在一起！有
恐怕没有老鼠在空中，但是您可能会捉到蝙蝠，这就是
就像鼠标一样。但是，我想知道猫吃蝙蝠吗？” 和这里
爱丽丝开始变得困倦，然后继续对自己说：
梦幻般的方式：“猫吃蝙蝠吗？猫吃蝙蝠吗？” 和
有时，“蝙蝠吃猫吗？” 你看，因为她无法回答
无论是哪个问题，她采用哪种方式都没关系。她觉得
她正在打do睡，刚刚开始梦见她在
与黛娜（Dinah）携手同行，并认真地对她说，
“现在，黛娜，告诉我实话：你吃过蝙蝠吗？” 突然间就，
扑通！扑通！下来，她碰到了一堆树枝和干树叶，
秋天结束了。

爱丽丝一点也不受伤，她一下子跳了起来：
她抬起头，可是头顶上全是黑暗的；在她是另一个之前
长途跋涉，白兔子仍在视线中，急忙下山
它。没什么可失去的：爱丽丝像风一样消失了，
当时正好听到它说，转弯时说：“哦，我的耳朵
和胡须，要多晚了！” 她在她身后
转过弯，但兔子不再可见：她发现
她自己在一个长长的低矮大厅里，被一排吊灯照亮
从屋顶。

大厅四周有门，但都锁着。什么时候
爱丽丝一直往下走，一直往另一边走，尽力
门，她可悲地走下中间，想知道自己过得如何
再次出去。

突然，她来到了一张三足的小桌子，桌子全都是坚固的
玻璃; 除了一个很小的金钥匙，没有其他东西，还有爱丽丝的
首先想到的是它可能属于大厅的一扇门；
可惜！锁太大或钥匙太小，
但无论如何，它不会打开任何一个。但是，第二
一段时间后，她来到了一个以前从未注意到的低帘，并且
它的后面是一扇约15英寸高的小门：她尝试了
锁上的小金钥匙，让她感到非常高兴！

爱丽丝打开门，发现它进入了一条小通道，没有
比老鼠洞大得多：她跪下，沿着
进入您见过的最美丽的花园。她多么渴望得到
从那个黑暗的大厅里走出来，在明亮的床铺中游荡
鲜花和那些凉爽的喷泉，但她什至无法昂首
通过门口；“即使我的头会过去，”思想
可怜的爱丽丝，“没有我的肩膀，这将毫无用处。哦，
我希望我能像望远镜一样闭嘴！我想我可以
知道如何开始。” 因为，你看，这么多偏僻的东西
最近发生了那件事，因为爱丽丝已经开始认为很少的事情
确实确实是不可能的。

等待在小门旁似乎没有用，所以她去了
回到桌子上，希望她可能在桌子上找到另一个钥匙，或者在
无论如何，像望远镜一样将人们封闭的规则书：
时候她在上面发现了一个小瓶子，（“那肯定不在这里
”，爱丽丝说，）在瓶子的脖子上是一张纸
标签上印有“ DRINK ME”字样，精美大方
字母。

说“喝我吧”真是太好了，但是聪明的小爱丽丝是
不会急着去做那个。“不，我先看，”她说，
“并查看是否标记为“ _poison_””；因为她读过
关于被烧伤的孩子的一些不错的小故事，以及
被野兽和其他不愉快的东西吞噬了，这都是因为它们
_不会记得他们的朋友教给他们的简单规则：
例如，如果持有时间过长，炽热的扑克会烧死您；
而且，如果您用刀非常深地切开手指，通常
出血 她从未忘记过，如果您从
标记为“毒药”的瓶子，几乎可以肯定与您不同意，
迟早。

但是，这个瓶子没有被标记为“毒药”，所以爱丽丝大胆地
尝一尝，发现它非常好，（事实上，它有点混杂
樱桃art，蛋ust，菠萝，火鸡，太妃糖和
热黄油烤面包，）她很快就完成了。

* * * * * * *

    * * * * * *

* * * * * * *


“多么奇怪的感觉！” 爱丽丝说；“我一定要闭嘴
望远镜。”

确实如此：她现在只有十英寸高，她的脸
想到她现在是合适的身材就大开眼界
通过小门进入那个美丽的花园。首先，她
等了几分钟，看看她是否会进一步缩小：
她对此感到有点紧张；“因为它可能会结束，”
爱丽丝对自己说：“我出去的时候就像蜡烛一样。一世
想知道那时我会是什么样吗？” 她试图幻想什么
蜡烛的火焰就像蜡烛吹完之后一样，因为她可以
不记得曾经见过这样的事情。

过了一会儿，发现什么也没发生，她决定继续
立即进入花园；但是，可怜的爱丽丝a！当她到达
门上，她发现自己忘记了小金钥匙，当她
回到桌子上去，她发现她不可能到达
它：她可以透过玻璃杯看得很清楚，然后尝试了一下
最好爬桌子的一只脚，但是太滑了；
当她厌倦了尝试时，那可怜的小东西
坐下来哭了。

“来吧，那样哭是没有用的！” 爱丽丝对自己说，
相当尖锐 “我建议您此刻不做！” 她一般
给自己很好的建议（尽管她很少遵循）
有时她如此严厉地责骂自己，以至于流下眼泪
她的眼睛; 而且一旦她想起要为自己的耳朵做个盒子
在她自己对自己玩的槌球游戏中作弊，
因为这个好奇的孩子非常喜欢假装两个人。
可怜的爱丽丝想：“但现在已经没有用了，假装是两个
人！为什么，我剩下的几乎不足以使_one_受人尊敬
人！”

很快她的眼睛落在桌子下面的一个小玻璃盒子上：
她打开它，在里面发现了一个很小的蛋糕，上面写着
黑醋栗中标有“ EAT ME”字样。“好吧，我会吃的，”说
爱丽丝，“而且如果它使我变得更大，我就可以找到关键所在。而如果
使我变得越来越小，我可以在门下爬行；所以无论哪种方式
进入花园，我不在乎会发生什么！”

她吃了一点，焦急地对自己说：“哪条路？哪一个
的方式？”，将手放在头顶上，感觉那是哪种方式
成长，她很惊讶地发现自己保持不变
大小：可以肯定，这通常发生在一个人吃蛋糕的时候，但是爱丽丝
已经有太多的期望，除了偏僻之外
发生的事情，似乎让生活变得愚蠢而愚蠢
以常见的方式打开。

于是她开始工作，很快就完成了蛋糕。

第二章
眼泪池


“越来越好奇！” 爱丽丝哭了（她非常惊讶，
目前，她完全忘记了说一口流利的英语）；“现在我
像有史以来最大的望远镜一样敞开！再见，脚！”
（因为当她低头看着自己的脚时，它们似乎快要消失了
视线，他们走得太远了）。“哦，我那可怜的小脚，我
亲爱的，您想知道谁现在会为您穿上鞋子和长筒袜吗？我是
确定_I_不能！我离麻烦还差得远
关于你自己：我必须尽力而为；但是我必须
对他们很友善，”爱丽丝想，“或者也许他们不会走我的路
想去！让我看看：我会给他们每双新靴子
圣诞。”

她继续自己计划如何管理它。“他们一定
她想：“以及发送后看起来会多么有趣
呈现自己的脚！方向看起来多么奇怪！

     _挡泥板附近，爱沙丝（Hearthrug）_爱丽丝的右脚，_（_
     爱丽丝的爱。

亲爱的，我在胡说八道！”

就在这时，她的头撞在大厅的屋顶上：事实上，她
现在已经超过九英尺高，她立刻拿起了小金
钥匙，赶紧走到花园门口。

可怜的爱丽丝！她躺在一边，尽力去做
一只眼睛直望花园；但是要获得更多
她比以往任何时候都更加无望：她坐下来，再次哭了起来。

爱丽丝说：“你应该为自己感到羞耻，一个像
您，”（她可能会这么说），“继续这样哭！停止
这刻，我告诉你！” 但她却继续前进，流下
一加仑的眼泪，直到她周围有一个大水池
四英寸深，到达大厅的一半。

过了一会儿，她听到远处的脚有些刺耳的声音，
她急忙干了眼，看看会发生什么。是白色
回来的兔子，穿着华丽，戴着一副白色的小孩手套
一只手，另一只大风扇：他来了
赶紧大声说道，“哦！公爵夫人
公爵夫人！哦! 如果我一直等她，她就不会野蛮！” 爱丽丝毡
如此绝望，她准备向任何人求助；所以，当
兔子靠近她，她低声怯began地说道：“如果你愿意，
先生，”兔子猛烈地起身，放下了白手套，
风扇，尽力向黑暗中走去。

爱丽丝拿起风扇和手套，由于大厅很热，她
她一直在说话时一直在扇着自己：“亲爱的，亲爱的！怎么样
奇怪的是今天的一切！昨天一切照常进行。
我想知道我是否在夜晚被改变了？让我想想：我是
今天早上起床时一样吗？我几乎以为我能记得的感觉
有点不同。但是如果我不一样，下一个问题是，谁
我在世界上吗？啊，那是一个伟大的难题！” 然后她开始
考虑所有她知道与她同龄的孩子
她自己，看看她是否可以为其中任何一个而改变。

她说：“我确定我不是艾达，因为她的头发长了这么久。
lets，而我的根本就没有in。我确定我不会
成为Mabel，因为我知道各种各样的事情，她，哦！她知道这样的
很少！此外，她是她，我是我，哦，亲爱的，
令人费解的是！如果我知道我以前知道的所有事情，我会尝试。
让我看看：四乘五等于十二，四乘六等于十三，
四乘七是-噢，亲爱的！那样我永远不会达到二十岁
率！但是，乘法表并不表示：让我们尝试
地理。伦敦是巴黎的首都，巴黎是巴黎的首都
罗马，罗马-不，那完全是错的，我敢肯定！我一定是
为Mabel改了！我会试着说“ _小孩子怎么了—'””她
双手交叉在膝上，好像在上课一样，开始
重复一遍，但是她的声音听起来沙哑而奇怪，
与过去不同：

“小鳄鱼怎么办
    改善他闪亮的尾巴，
倒入尼罗河的水
    在每一个黄金尺度上！

“他似乎很高兴地笑了，
    爪子如何整齐地张开，
并欢迎小鱼进来
    下巴轻轻一笑！”


可怜的爱丽丝和她的眼睛说：“我敢肯定那些词是不正确的。”
她继续说道，再次充满了泪水：“我毕竟必须是玛贝尔，而且
我将不得不去那间破烂不堪的小房子里生活，并在旁边
没有玩具可玩，哦！有太多的教训要学习！不，我有
我下定决心 如果我是Mabel，我会留在这里！这将是
不要用低着头说：“再来，亲爱的！”
我只会抬头说：“那我是谁？先告诉我，然后
然后，如果我喜欢做那个人，我会上来的；如果不喜欢，我会留下来的
在这里，直到我成为别人。”但是，天哪！” 爱丽丝哭了起来
泪流满面，“我希望他们_垂头丧气！我是
_非常_厌倦了独自一人在这里！”

正如她所说的那样，她低头看着她的手，很惊讶地看到
她戴着兔子的白色小小孩手套之一
她在说话。“我怎么能做到这一点？” 她想。“我必须
又变小了。” 她起身去桌子旁测量
自己发现了，几乎可以猜到，
现在大约两英尺高，并且正在迅速缩小：她很快
发现原因是她拿着风扇，她
匆忙地将其丢弃，只是为了避免完全缩小。

“那是一个狭窄的逃生！” 爱丽丝说，吓坏了很多人。
突然的变化，但很高兴发现自己仍然存在；“和
现在去花园！” 然后她全速跑回小
门：但是，las！小门又关了，小金门
钥匙像以前一样躺在玻璃桌上，“情况比
可怜的孩子想，“因为我从来没有像现在这样小
以前从来没有！我声明这太糟糕了！”

当她说出这些话时，她的脚滑了下来。
溅！她在盐水中下巴。她的第一个想法是
她以某种方式掉入海中，“那样的话，我可以回去
铁路。”她对自己说。（爱丽丝曾经去过海边
她的生活，并得出了一个普遍的结论，那就是无论你走到哪里
在英属海岸，您会在
海，一些孩子用木制锹挖沙子，然后排
住的房子，在他们后面是火车站。）但是，她
很快就发现她在哭泣的眼泪池中
她身高九英尺。

“我希望我没有那么哭！” 爱丽丝游说时说，尝试
找到她的出路。“我现在应该为此受到惩罚，
被我自己的眼泪淹死！那将是一个奇怪的事情
当然！但是，今天的一切都很奇怪。”

就在这时，她听到游泳池里溅出一些东西
离开，她游得更近，以了解那是什么：起初，她以为
它一定是海象或河马，但后来她想起来有多小
她现在是，她很快就发现那只老鼠
像她自己一样溜进去。

“现在，和这只老鼠说话会有用吗？”
这里的一切都那么遥不可及，我应该非常思考
它可能会说话：无论如何，尝试没有任何危害。” 所以她
开始说：“噢老鼠，你知道从这个游泳池出来的路吗？我很累
老鼠在这里游泳的感觉！” （爱丽丝认为这一定是正确的
和老鼠说话的方式：她以前从未做过这种事，但是
她记得自己在哥哥的拉丁文法文中看到过
一只老鼠-一只老鼠-一只老鼠-O老鼠！”）老鼠看着她，
好奇地，在她看来，它的一只小眼睛眨了眨眼，
但是什么也没说。

“也许它听不懂英语，”爱丽丝想道；“我敢说这是
法国老鼠，和征服者威廉一起过来。” （对于所有
爱丽丝（Alice）对历史有很深的了解，直到多年前
一切都发生了。）于是她又开始说：“你聊天吗？” 哪一个
是她的法语课本中的第一句话。老鼠给了
突然跳出水面，似乎浑身发抖
害怕 “哦，对不起！” 爱丽丝匆匆哭了，怕她
伤害了那只可怜的动物的感情。“我很忘了你不喜欢
猫。”

“不像猫！” 老鼠用尖利而热情的声音喊道。“将
如果你是我，你喜欢猫吗？”

“好吧，也许不行，”爱丽丝用舒缓的语气说：“不要生气。
关于它。但是我希望我能给你看我们的猫黛娜：我想你会
如果只看到猫，那就看上猫吧。她是如此亲爱的
安静的事情，”爱丽丝懒洋洋地游来游去，半步对自己说
在游泳池里，“她坐在炉火旁，呼呼地舔着她
用爪子洗脸-她是如此柔软，
护士-她是捉老鼠的资本家-噢，求求你
赦免！” 爱丽丝再次哭泣，这一次，老鼠正在扑腾
结束了，她确定必须真的得罪了。“我们不会说话
如果不想的话，可以再谈谈她。”

“我们确实！” 老鼠哭了，老鼠一直颤抖到尽头
尾巴。“好像_I_会谈论这样的话题！我们一家人总是
_讨厌的猫：讨厌，低落，粗俗的东西！不要让我听到这个名字
再次！”

“我真的不会！” 爱丽丝说，非常急于改变
会话。“您-您喜欢狗吗？” 鼠标没有
答案，所以爱丽丝热切地继续说道：“附近有一只很好的小狗
我们的房子我想给你看！有点眼花ter乱的狗，你
知道了，哦，长长的棕色卷发！当它会取东西
你把它们扔掉，它会坐起来乞讨它的晚餐，各种各样
事情-我不记得其中一半了-它属于一个农民，你
知道，他说这很有用，价值一百英镑！他说
它杀死了所有的老鼠，而且-亲爱的！” 爱丽丝悲哀地哭了，
“恐怕又得罪了！” 因为老鼠在游走
从她身上竭尽全力，并在
游泳池。

因此，她轻声说道：“亲爱的老鼠！再次回来，我们
如果您不喜欢猫或狗，也不会谈论它们！” 当。。。的时候
老鼠听到了这个声音，它转过身，慢慢游回她身边：它的脸
脸色苍白（充满激情，爱丽丝想），它低沉地说
颤抖的声音，“让我们到岸边，然后我告诉你我的
历史，您将了解为什么我讨厌猫和狗。”

现在该走了，因为游泳池已经挤满了
掉进去的鸟和动物：有只鸭子和一只
渡渡鸟，鹦鹉和小鹰以及其他几种好奇的生物。爱丽丝
带路，整个队伍游到岸上。




第三章
核心种族和长篇故事


他们确实是一个聚集在银行的怪异党派，
羽毛飞舞的鸟儿，毛皮紧贴的动物
对他们来说，所有的水滴都湿，交叉，不舒服。

当然，第一个问题是如何再次变干：他们有一个
对此进行了咨询，几分钟后，
爱丽丝很自然地发现自己与他们交谈，就像
她一生都认识他们。确实，她有很长的争论
与劳瑞（Lory）在一起，他终于变得阴郁，只会说：“我是
比您大，并且必须了解更多；” 而这个爱丽丝不允许
不知道它多大了，而且，因为Lory积极拒绝
告诉它的年龄，没有更多要说的了。

最后，老鼠，似乎是其中的权威人物，
大声喊道：“大家坐下，听我说！_我会_很快
你干够了！” 他们一下子围成一圈坐下，
鼠标在中间。爱丽丝焦急地盯着它，因为她
我感到如果很快不干的话，她一定会患上重感冒。

“哎呀！” 老鼠以一种重要的姿态说道：“大家都准备好了吗？这个
是我所知道的最干燥的事情。如果您愿意，请保持沉默！'威廉
征服者的原因受到了教皇的青睐，很快就提交了
到了英国，他想要领导人，并且已经很晚了
习惯于篡夺和征服。埃德温（Edwin）和莫卡（Morcar），
梅西亚和诺桑比亚–'”

“啊！” 洛瑞颤抖着说。

“请再说一遍！” 老鼠皱着眉头说，但很客气：
你说？”

“不是我！” 劳瑞仓促地说。

“我以为你做到了，”老鼠说。“-我继续。埃德温和莫卡，
梅西亚和诺森比亚的伯爵为他宣布：甚至
坎特伯雷爱国大主教斯蒂格德（Stigand）发现它是可取的-'”

“发现了什么？” 鸭子说。

“发现了它，”老鼠颇为盘问：“你当然知道
这是什么意思。”

“我知道，'_'发现某物时，它的含义足够好，”
鸭子：“通常是青蛙或蠕虫。问题是，
大主教找到了吗？”

鼠标没有注意到这个问题，但是急忙继续说：
建议与埃德加·阿特林（Edgar Atheling）见面，并邀请威廉
皇冠。威廉一开始的举止是温和的。但是无礼
他的诺曼家族中的一员-“亲爱的，你现在过得怎么样？” 它继续
说着爱丽丝。

爱丽丝用忧郁的语气说：“像以往一样潮湿”
彻底干了我。”

“那样的话，”渡渡鸟庄严地说，“我走了。
会议休会，以便立即通过，精力充沛
补救措施—”

“说英语！” 伊格尔特说。“我不知道一半的含义
那些长话，而且，我也不相信你也这样做！” 和
伊格尔特弯下腰来掩饰微笑：其他一些鸟
可听见地滴滴答答。

“我要说的是，”渡渡鸟生气地说，“是的，
让我们干透的最好的事情就是核心比赛。”

“什么是核心小组竞赛？” 爱丽丝说；不是说她很想
知道，但是渡渡鸟已经停下来，好像它认为_somebody_应该
说话，似乎没人愿意说什么。

“为什么”，渡渡鸟说，“解释它的最好方法就是去做。” （和，
您可能想自己尝试一下，在某个冬季，我会
告诉您渡渡鸟是如何管理的。）

首先，它以某种圆圈标记了一个赛道（“
形状没关系，”它说，）然后所有的聚会都摆好了
在整个过程中，到处都是。没有“一，二，三和
走开”，但他们在喜欢的时候就开始跑步，而在他们离开时就放弃了
喜欢，所以不容易知道比赛何时结束。然而，
他们已经跑了半个小时左右，而且很干
渡渡鸟再次突然大喊“比赛结束了！” 他们都
围着它拥挤，气喘吁吁，问：“但是谁赢了？”

如果没有很多建议，渡渡鸟无法回答这个问题
想了一下，它用一个手指压了很长时间
前额（您通常在莎士比亚中看到莎士比亚的位置
他的照片），而其他人则默默地等待着。最后渡渡鸟
说：“每个人都赢了，所有人都必须有奖品。”

“但是谁来奖励呢？” 相当多的声音问。

“为什么，她，当然。”渡渡鸟一边指着爱丽丝一边说。
手指; 整个聚会立刻拥挤在她身边，
困惑的方式，“奖品！奖品！”

爱丽丝不知道该怎么办，在绝望中，她把手放在她的怀里。
口袋里，掏出一盒面包，（幸运的是盐水
而不参加），并把它们作为奖品交给。确实有
一个，一个，全部。

老鼠说：“但是她自己必须得奖。”

“当然，”渡渡鸟非常严肃地回答。“你还进了什么
你的口袋？” 他继续，转向爱丽丝。

“只有一个顶针，”爱丽丝悲伤地说道。

“把它交给这里，”渡渡鸟说。

然后他们都再次拥挤她，而渡渡鸟则庄严地
提出了顶针，说：“我们请您接受这种优雅
顶针;” 当这简短的演讲结束时，他们都
欢呼

爱丽丝认为整件事很荒谬，但他们看上去都很严肃
她不敢笑；而且，因为她什么都没想到
可以说，她只是鞠躬，拿起顶针，看上去像
她可以。

接下来的事情就是吃这种蛋奶：这引起了一些噪音，
困惑，因为大鸟抱怨他们无法品尝
他们的，小家伙cho住了，不得不拍在后面。
但是，终于结束了，他们再次坐了下来，
恳求老鼠告诉他们更多信息。

爱丽丝说：“你答应告诉我你的历史，为什么？
是你恨-C和D，”她轻声说道，半点害怕
会再次冒犯。

“我的故事是一个漫长而可悲的故事！” 老鼠说，转向爱丽丝，
叹气。

“那肯定是一条长长的尾巴，”爱丽丝惊讶地低头说道。
在老鼠的尾巴；“但是为什么你这么难过呢？” 她继续
老鼠在说话时对此感到困惑，所以她对
故事是这样的：

         “弗里对老鼠说，他在屋子里遇到了，'让我们俩
         遵守法律：_I_将起诉_you _。——来吧，我不接受
         否认; 我们必须进行审判：今天早上我真的
         没事做。' 老鼠对治疗师说：“亲爱的，这样的审判。
         先生，没有陪审团或裁判，那会浪费我们的呼吸。
         狡猾的老愤怒说：“我将做法官，陪审员。
         尝试整个事业，并谴责您至死。””

“你不参加！” 老鼠严厉地对爱丽丝说。“什么是
你在想什么？”

“对不起，”爱丽丝谦卑地说：“您已经到了第五名。
我想弯曲吗？”

“我没有_！”老鼠敏锐而愤怒地喊道。

“打结！” 爱丽丝说，一直准备让自己变得有用，并且看着
担心她。“哦，请让我帮助您撤消它！”

“我不会做任何事情，”老鼠说，站起来，
正在走开。“你这样胡说八道侮辱我！”

“我不是那个意思！” 恳求可怜的爱丽丝。“但是你很容易被冒犯，
你懂！”

鼠标只在回应中咆哮。

“请回来并完成您的故事！” 爱丽丝接过电话。和
其他人都参加了合唱，“是的，请做！” 但是只有鼠标
不耐烦地摇了摇头，走得更快。

“可惜不会留下来的！” 劳瑞（Lory）叹了一口气
完全看不见 一位老螃蟹趁机说
她的女儿“啊，亲爱的！让这成为你永远不要失去的教训
_你脾气！” “妈，别说话！” 年轻的螃蟹说，
兴高采烈。“您足够尝试牡蛎的耐心！”

“我希望我在这里有我们的迪纳，我知道我做到了！” 爱丽丝大声说，
特别针对任何人。“她很快就会把它取回来！”

“迪娜是谁？如果我敢问这个问题的话？” 说
好好

爱丽丝热切地回答，因为她一直准备谈论她的宠物：
黛娜是我们的猫。她是捉老鼠的资本家
想不到！哦，我希望你能在飞鸟之后见到她！为什么，
她一看就会吃掉一只小鸟！”

这次讲话引起了党内的轰动。某些
鸟类立刻奔走：一只老喜began开始把自己包裹起来
仔细地说道：“我真的一定要回家；夜空
不适合我的喉咙！” 金丝雀发出颤抖的声音
对孩子们说：“亲爱的，快走吧！现在是时候你们都在
床！” 他们以各种借口全部离开，爱丽丝很快就离开了
单独。

“我希望我没有提到黛娜！” 她忧郁地对自己说
音。“在这儿似乎没人喜欢她，我敢肯定她是最好的
世界上的猫！哦，亲爱的黛娜！我不知道我会不会见到你
还有！” 可怜的爱丽丝在这里再次哭泣，因为她感到非常
孤独而沮丧。过了一会儿，她再次听到
远处的脚步声几乎没有打扰，她抬起头
渴望地，一半希望老鼠改变了主意，
回来完成他的故事。




第四章
兔子寄了一点帐单


是白兔子，再次缓慢跑回去，看着
焦虑不安，好像丢失了什么东西；她听到了
它喃喃自语“公爵夫人！公爵夫人！噢，亲爱的爪子！哦
我的皮毛和胡须！她会让我被处决，就像雪貂一样
雪貂！我想知道我可以把它们放在哪里？” 爱丽丝猜中了
当时正在寻找风扇和一对白人
手套，她很善良地开始寻找它们，但是
他们无处可寻-从那以后一切似乎都发生了变化
她在游泳池和大厅里游泳，还有玻璃桌和
小门，完全消失了。

兔子很快就注意到爱丽丝（Alice）在狩猎时，
叫她在愤怒的语气，“为什么，玛丽安，什么_are_你
在这里做？这刻跑回家，给我拿来一副手套，
粉丝！快点，现在！爱丽丝非常害怕，逃跑了
立即按照它所指的方向进行操作，而无需试图解释
它犯了错误。

“他带我去当女佣，”她在奔跑时对自己说。“怎么样
当他发现我是谁时，他会感到惊讶！但我最好带他
他的风扇和手套-也就是说，如果我能找到它们的话。” 就像她说的那样
碰到一个整洁的小房子，门上是一盏明亮的黄铜
带有“ W. 兔子”。她没有进去
敲门，急忙上楼，以免她见面。
真正的玛丽·安（Mary Ann），在她找到
风扇和手套。

爱丽丝对自己说：“看起来有多奇怪？
一只兔子！我想迪纳会在接下来的消息中发给我！” 和她
开始幻想发生的事情：“'爱丽丝小姐！来
直接在这里，准备走走吧！” '一分钟后，
护士！但是我必须看到鼠标没有弹出。” 只有我
别想，”爱丽丝继续说，“他们会让迪娜停在屋子里
如果它开始这样命令人们！”

到了这个时候，她已经找到了进入整洁的小房间的桌子的路
在窗户上，在窗户上（如她希望的那样），风扇和两三个
一双白色的小小孩手套：她拿起风扇和一双
手套，正要离开房间，当她的眼睛落在
站在镜子旁边的小瓶子。没有标签
这次用“ DRINK ME”这个词，但是她还是把它开塞了
放在嘴唇上 “我知道有趣的事一定会
她对自己说，“无论何时我吃东西或喝东西，都会发生。所以
我只看这瓶酒做什么。我希望这会让我长大
再次，因为真的让我厌倦了这么小的事情！”

确实如此，而且比她预期的要早得多：
喝了一半的瓶子，她发现她的头压在天花板上，
不得不弯腰以免脖子受伤。她急忙把
倒在瓶子里，对自己说：“够了，我希望我不要
继续成长-就这样，我不能走到门外-我希望我没有
太醉了！”

唉! 希望现在为时已晚！她继续成长，成长中，
很快不得不跪在地上：再过一分钟
甚至没有足够的空间，她试着躺下
一只手肘靠在门上，另一只胳膊ed着头。
仍然她继续成长，作为最后的资源，她伸出一只手臂
窗外，一只脚爬上烟囱，对自己说：“现在我
无论发生什么，都无法做。我会怎样？”

幸运的是，对于爱丽丝来说，这个小魔术瓶已经发挥了全部作用，
她长得更大了：仍然很不舒服，而且
她似乎没有机会离开房间
再一次，难怪她感到不高兴。

可怜的爱丽丝（Alice）说：“家里很愉快，
总是越来越大，并受到老鼠和
兔子。我几乎希望我还没有落到那个兔子洞里，但是
但是，这种生活真是令人好奇！我确实想知道
_可以发生在我身上！当我以前读童话时，我幻想
这种事情从来没有发生过，现在我在这里
之一！应该有一本关于我的书，应该有！和
当我长大后，我会写一个-但我现在长大了，”她在
悲伤的语气 “至少这里没有成长的空间。”

“但是，”爱丽丝想，“我永远都不要比我大
现在？这将是一种安慰，一种方式-永远不要做老妇-但是
然后-总是要上课！哦，我不应该喜欢_that！_”

“哦，你真是愚蠢的爱丽丝！” 她回答自己。“你如何学习
在这里上课？为什么，几乎没有_you_的空间，根本没有空间
任何教科书！”

因此，她继续前进，首先走到一边，然后走到另一边，然后
完全进行了交谈；但几分钟后
她听到外面有声音，停下来听。

“玛丽安！玛丽安！” 声音说。“这时给我拿我的手套！”
然后在楼梯上脚踩了一下。爱丽丝知道那是
兔子来找她，她发抖，直到摇了摇。
房子，完全忘记了她现在大约是她的一千倍
像兔子一样大，没有理由害怕它。

不久，兔子走到门前，试图打开它。但是，作为
门向内打开，爱丽丝的肘部用力压在门上，
那个尝试证明是失败的。爱丽丝听见自己说：“那我会
转身进入窗户。”

“那你不会！” 爱丽丝想，等到她幻想了之后
她听到兔子在窗下，突然把她摊开
的手，在空中抢夺。她什么都没拿
但是她听到了一点尖叫和跌倒的声音，还有碎玻璃的撞击声，
她从中得出的结论是，它很有可能陷入了
黄瓜框架或类似的东西。

接下来是愤怒的声音-兔子的声音-“帕特！拍！你在哪？” 和
然后是她从未听过的声音，“当然，我在这里！挖掘
苹果，您的荣幸！”

“确实在挖苹果！” 兔子生气地说。“这里！来吧
帮我摆脱_this！_”（碎玻璃的声音。）

“现在告诉我，帕特，窗户里是什么？”

“当然，这是手臂，您的荣幸！” （他说“ arrum”。）

“一只胳膊，你的鹅！谁见过这么大的一个？为什么，它充满了整个
窗口！”

“当然，确实，您的荣誉：但这是所有这些的帮助。”

“好吧，无论如何，这里没有生意：去把它拿走！”

此后沉寂了很长时间，爱丽丝只能听到耳语。
时不时; 例如，“当然，我不喜欢，您的荣幸，根本
所有！” “照我说的做，你这个胆小鬼！” 最后她散开了她的
再次伸手，空中又抢了一下。这次有
_two_小小的尖叫声，以及更多碎玻璃的声音。“什么数字
必须有黄瓜架！” 爱丽丝想。“我纳闷
他们接下来会做！至于把我拉出窗外，我只希望他们
_可能！_我确定_I_不想再留在这里！”

她等了一段时间，没有再听到任何声音：
小车轮的隆隆声和很多声音的声音
一起聊天：她说出了这样的话：“另一个在哪里
梯子？-为什么，我只带一个；比尔有另一个-比尔！
小伙子，在这里拿它！—在这里，把它们放在这个角落—不，绑起来
首先在一起-他们还没有达到一半的高度-哦！他们会做
足够好; 别特别，比尔！抓住这个
绳索-屋顶会承受吗？-记住那块松散的石板-哦，它要倒了！
头下面！” （一声巨响）—“现在，那是谁做的？—是比尔，我
看中了-谁要顺着烟囱走？-不，我不！_你做
它！—那么，我不会！—比尔要下去—在这里，比尔！主人说
你要去烟囱了！”

“哦！因此，比尔必须从烟囱上下来，对吗？爱丽丝对
她自己。“害羞，他们似乎把一切都交给了比尔！我不会在
比尔有很多地方：可以肯定，这个壁炉很窄。但
我_想_我可以踢一点！

她将脚尽可能地往烟囱下垂，一直等到
她听到了一只小动物（她无法猜出它是哪种动物）
在她上方的烟囱中刮擦和爬行：然后，
她对自己说：“这是比尔。”她猛踢了一脚，然后等待
看看接下来会发生什么。

她听到的第一件事是大声合唱“比尔去了！”
然后兔子的声音就走了-“抓住他，你在树篱旁！” 然后
沉默，然后又是另一种声音的混乱-“抬起头-白兰地
现在-不要cho他-老家伙怎么样了？你怎么了？告诉
我们都知道了！”

最后传来一阵微弱，刺耳的声音（“那是比尔，”
爱丽丝（Alice），“嗯，我几乎不知道-不用了，谢谢。我现在好多了，但我
一件事情太仓促了，无法告诉您-我所知道的是，我身上发生了一些事情
像盒子里的箱子，然后我就飞起来了！”

“所以你做到了，老家伙！” 其他人说。

“我们必须把房子烧毁！” 兔子的声音说。和爱丽丝
她尽可能大声喊道，“如果你愿意，我会把黛娜放在你身边！”

瞬间寂静无声，爱丽丝心想：“我
想知道他们下一步会做什么！如果他们有任何感觉，他们会选择
屋顶关闭。” 一两分钟后，他们又开始走动，
爱丽丝听兔子说：“一开始便是个讨人喜欢的人。”

爱丽丝想道：“一大堆_什么？_。” 但是她不久就怀疑了
下一刻，小鹅卵石在
窗户，其中一些打她的脸。“我会停下来
她对自己说，然后大声喊道，“你最好不要那样做。
再次！” 产生了另一个死寂。

爱丽丝惊奇地发现鹅卵石都变成了
他们躺在地板上的小蛋糕，一个聪明的主意走进了她
头。她说：“如果我吃这些蛋糕之一，那肯定会
_我的尺寸有所变化；而且因为它不可能使我变大，所以
我想必须让我变小。”

所以她吞下了一个蛋糕，很高兴发现她
开始直接缩小。只要她小到足以
穿过门，她跑出家门，发现一大堆
小动物和鸟类在外面等着。可怜的小蜥蜴比尔，
在中间，被两只豚鼠牵着，正在给它
瓶子里有东西。他们一见到爱丽丝，便全都着急
出现 但是她尽了最大努力逃跑了，很快就找到了自己
安全地放在厚厚的木头里。

“我要做的第一件事，”爱丽丝对自己说。
在树林里徘徊，“就是要再次长到我合适的大小；和
第二件事是找到进入那个美丽花园的路。我觉得
将是最好的计划。”

无疑，这听起来是一个很棒的计划，而且非常简洁
安排 唯一的困难是，她没有最小的想法
如何设置；当她焦急地凝视着
树木，头顶上有一个尖锐的树皮，使她抬头望去。
快点

一只巨大的小狗睁大眼睛低头看着她，然后
虚弱地伸出一只爪子，试图抚摸她。“可怜的小
事情！” 爱丽丝用哄哄的口气说，她努力吹口哨。
它; 但是她一直以为这件事使她非常恐惧
可能饿了，在这种情况下很可能会把她吃掉
尽管她全都哄着。

她几乎不知道自己做了什么，就捡起一点棍子，然后
拿出来给小狗 小狗就跳到空中了
它的双脚立刻发出欢呼声，冲向棍子，
并让自己担心。然后爱丽丝躲在一株大蓟后面，
防止自己被碾压；当她出现在
另一侧，小狗又猛冲了棍子，摇了摇头
急于抓住它; 然后爱丽丝，以为是
非常像玩马车游戏，并期待每一个
踩在脚下的那一刻，再次绕过蓟。然后
小狗开始了一系列的短暂充电，跑了非常
每次前进的路很少，而前进的路很长，嘶哑地吠叫
一直到最后它都坐了好路，喘着粗气，
它的舌头从嘴里伸出来，大眼睛闭上了一半。

在爱丽丝看来，这是一个使她逃脱的好机会。所以她
立刻出发，跑到她很累，气喘吁吁，
直到那只小狗的树皮在远处听起来很微弱。

“可是那是一只多么可爱的小狗！” 爱丽丝边说边说。
靠在毛to上休息，然后扇动其中一只
离开：“如果我愿意，我应该非常喜欢教它的把戏
只有合适的尺寸才能做到！噢亲爱的！我几乎忘记了
我必须再次长大！让我看看-如何管理它？一世
假设我应该吃东西或其他东西；但是很棒
问题是什么？”

当然，最大的问题是，什么？爱丽丝环顾四周
花和草叶，但她没有看到任何东西
在这种情况下看起来像是正确的饮食。
她附近长着一个大蘑菇，高度与
她自己 当她从下面看时，在它的两侧，以及
在她的背后，她想到她不妨看看
在它的顶部。

她tip起脚尖，窥视着边缘。
蘑菇，她的眼睛立刻见到了一只大毛毛虫，
双臂交叉坐在顶部，安静地抽着烟
长长的水烟筒，对她或任何东西都毫不留神
其他。




第五章
毛毛虫的建议


卡特彼勒（Caterpillar）和爱丽丝（Alice）互相看着了一段时间
沉默：毛毛虫终于从口中把水烟从嘴里拿了出来，
用沉闷，困倦的声音对她说。

“谁是你？_”毛毛虫说。

这不是进行对话的令人鼓舞的机会。爱丽丝回答，
有点害羞，“我-先生，我现在几乎不知道-至少我知道
我今天早上起床时是谁，但我想我一定是
从那以后改变了几次。”

“你是什么意思？” 卡特彼勒严厉地说。“说明
你自己！”

爱丽丝说：“先生，我无法解释自己，我是，因为我
你知道的不是我自己。”

“我看不到，”卡特彼勒说。

“恐怕我不能说得更清楚了，”爱丽丝很客气地回答，
“因为我自己一开始就不理解它；而且很多
一天中的不同大小非常令人困惑。”

卡特彼勒说：“不是。”

“好吧，也许您还没有找到它，”爱丽丝说。“但是当你
必须变成一个ry，你将有一天知道，然后
之后变成蝴蝶，我想你会感觉到一点
奇怪，不是吗？

“没什么，”卡特彼勒说。

“好吧，也许您的感受可能有所不同，”爱丽丝说。“据我所知
是，对_me_感到很奇怪。”

“您！” 卡特彼勒轻蔑地说。“你是谁？_”

这又使他们回到了对话的开始。
爱丽丝对毛毛虫的这种制造感到非常恼火。
简短的讲话，她起身说，非常严肃地说，“我
想，你应该先告诉我你是谁。”

“为什么？” 卡特彼勒说。

这是另一个令人困惑的问题。正如爱丽丝想不到的
有充分的理由，而且卡特彼勒（Caterpillar）似乎非常不愉快
精神状态下，她转身离开。

“回来！” 卡特彼勒叫了她一下。“我有东西
重要的是要说！”

当然，这听起来很有希望：爱丽丝转身回来。

“保持脾气，”卡特彼勒说。

“这就是全部？” 爱丽丝说，吞下了她的愤怒和她
可以。

“不，”卡特彼勒说。

爱丽丝认为她最好等一下，因为她无事可做，
也许毕竟这可以告诉她一些值得一听的东西。对于
几分钟后，它不说话就喘着粗气，但最后它就展开了
它的胳膊，再次将水烟从嘴里拿出，然后说：
以为你变了，对吗？

“我很抱歉，先生。”爱丽丝说。“我无法记住事情
曾经使用过-我在一起十分钟都不会保持相同的大小！”

“记不清什么了？” 卡特彼勒说。

“好吧，我试着说“忙碌的小蜜蜂怎么办”，但全部
变得不一样了！” 爱丽丝以非常忧郁的声音回答。

“重复，“ _您老了，威廉神父，'，”毛毛虫说。

爱丽丝折手，开始：

“你老了，威廉神父。”年轻人说，
    “你的头发变得非常白。
然而，你却不断地站在你的头上-
    您认为您的年龄是对的吗？”

“在我青年时期，”威廉神父回答他的儿子，
    “我担心它会伤害大脑。
但是，现在我完全确定自己没有
    为什么，我一次又一次。”

年轻人说：“您老了，如我之前所说，
    并且生长了最不常见的脂肪；
可是你在门口向后翻身
    祈祷，这是什么原因？”

贤哲说，“在我青年时期，”他摇了摇灰色锁，
    “我的四肢非常柔软
通过使用这种药膏-先将药盒弄干-
    请允许我卖给你一对？

年轻人说：“你老了，你的下巴太虚弱了
    任何比羊脂硬的东西；
但是您用骨头和喙完成了鹅，
    祈祷，你是如何做到的？”

他父亲说：“我年轻时就遵守法律，
    并与我的妻子争辩每个案件；
还有给我下巴的肌肉力量
    延续了我的余生。”

年轻人说：“你老了，几乎没人会想到
    你的眼睛一如既往地稳定；
然而，您在鼻子的尾端平衡了一条鳗鱼，
    是什么让您如此聪明？”

“我已经回答了三个问题，这就足够了，”
    他父亲说；“不要吹牛！
你认为我可以整天听这些东西吗？
    下车，不然我就踢你下楼梯！”


“那说的不对，”卡特彼勒说。

“恐怕不正确，”爱丽丝怯怯地说道。“某些
话已经变了。”

卡特彼勒坚定地说：“从头到尾都是错误的。”
沉默了几分钟。

卡特彼勒是第一个发言的人。

“你想成为什么尺寸？” 它问。

“哦，我对身材不特别，”爱丽丝急忙回答。“只有一个
您知道，不喜欢这么频繁地更改。”

“我不知道，”毛毛虫说。

爱丽丝一言不发：她的生活从未如此矛盾。
以前，她觉得自己发脾气了。

“你现在满意吗？” 卡特彼勒说。

“好吧，先生，如果您不愿意的话，我想大一点
爱丽丝说：“三英寸真是太可怜了。”

“确实是一个非常高的高度！” 卡特彼勒生气地说，
说话时将自己竖立起来（正好三英寸高）。

“但是我不习惯！” 用可怜的语气恳求可怜的爱丽丝。和她
想起自己，“我希望这些生物不会那么容易
得罪了！”

卡特彼勒说：“您会及时习惯的。” 然后把
水烟进入它的嘴，并再次开始吸烟。

这次，爱丽丝耐心地等待着，直到它选择再次讲话。在一个
一两分钟后，毛毛虫将水烟从嘴里拿出来，
打哈欠一次或两次，然后摇了摇头。然后它下来了
蘑菇，然后爬到草丛中，只说了一下，
“一侧会让你长高，而另一侧会让你
变短。”

“ _what？_的另一侧？_” Alice想。
她自己。

“在蘑菇中，”毛毛虫说，就像她要的那样。
大声 再过一会儿就看不见了。

爱丽丝仍然沉思地看着蘑菇一分钟，
试图找出其中的两个方面；照原样
圆圆的，她发现这是一个非常困难的问题。但是，在
最后，她将胳膊伸到了尽头，摔断了。
每只手都有一点优势。

“那是哪个？” 她对自己说，and了一点
尝试效果的右手位：下一刻，她感到
下巴下猛烈的一击：它击中了她的脚！

她对这种突然的变化感到非常恐惧，但她感到
她正在迅速萎缩，没有时间可以浪费；所以她
马上开始工作，吃点其他东西。下巴受压
紧贴着她的脚，几乎没有打开她的空间
口; 但她终于做到了，并设法吞下了
左手位。

    * * * * * *

* * * * * * *


“过来，我的头终于有空了！” 爱丽丝高兴地说道，
当她发现自己的肩膀在另一刻变成了警报
无处可寻：当她低头看时，她所能看到的就是
巨大的脖子长度，看起来像茎秆一样上升
远在她下方的绿叶海。

“所有这些绿色东西可以是什么？” 爱丽丝说。“还有我的
肩膀到了？哦，我可怜的手，怎么看不到你呢？”
她说话时正在四处走动，但似乎没有结果，
除了在遥远的绿叶间微微摇晃。

由于似乎没有机会举起双手，
她试图低头对待他们，很高兴发现
她的脖子容易向任何方向弯曲，就像蛇一样。她
刚刚成功地将其弯曲成优美的锯齿形，
打算潜入树叶之中，她发现这不过是什么
她一直游荡的树梢，
嘶嘶声使她匆匆退缩：一只大鸽子飞进了她的体内
面对，并用翅膀猛烈地殴打她。

“蛇！” 鸽子尖叫。

“我不是蛇！” 爱丽丝愤慨地说。“让我一个人静一静！”

“蛇，我再说一遍！” 重复鸽子，但在柔和
语气，并加上一种哭泣，“我已经尽了一切努力，没有
似乎适合他们！”

“我至少不知道你在说什么，”爱丽丝说。

“我尝试过树的根，尝试过河岸，也尝试过
树篱，”鸽子继续，没有照顾她。“但是那些
蛇！没有什么好玩的！”

爱丽丝越来越困​​惑，但她认为
再说一遍，直到鸽子完成。

鸽子说：“好像孵化卵还不够麻烦。”
“但是我必须日夜注意蛇！为什么我
这三个星期没睡觉了！”

“对不起，您已经感到恼火，”开始
看到它的意思。

“就像我把树林中最高的树拿走一样，”
鸽子发出尖叫声，“就像我一直在想
最终应该摆脱他们，他们必须将需求拖垮
从天上来！gh，蛇！”

“但是，我不是蛇，我告诉你！” 爱丽丝说。“我是-我是-”

“好！_你是做什么的？” 鸽子说。“我可以看到您正在尝试
发明点东西！”

“我-我是一个小女孩，”爱丽丝想起来很怀疑地说道。
她那天经历的更改次数。

“确实是一个可能的故事！” 鸽子用最深沉的语气说
鄙视。“我曾经见过很多小女孩，但从来没有
_one_那样的脖子！不，不！你是蛇 还有
否认没有用。我想你接下来会告诉我你永远不会
尝到了一个鸡蛋！

“我确实尝过鸡蛋，”爱丽丝很诚实
儿童; “但是小女孩吃的鸡蛋和蛇一样多，你
知道。”

鸽子说：“我不相信。” “但是如果这样做，那为什么
他们是一条蛇，我只能说这些。”

对爱丽丝来说，这是一个新主意，她很沉默
一两分钟，这让鸽子有机会添加“
寻找鸡蛋，我知道得足够多；那有什么关系
我是你是小女孩还是蛇？”

“对我来说，这很重要，”爱丽丝匆匆说。“但我不是
寻找鸡蛋，因为它发生了；如果我是，我不想要
_yours_：我不喜欢它们的原始内容。

“那么，那就走吧！” 鸽子沉闷地说道
再次进入巢穴。爱丽丝也蹲在树林中
尽她所能，因为她的脖子一直缠绕在树枝间，
她不时地不得不停下来并解开它。过了一会儿
她记得自己仍然握着蘑菇片，
她开始非常细心地工作，先是一次蚕食
另一个，有时长高有时短，直到
她成功地使自己跌落到平常的高度。

自从她长到合适的身材已经很久了，
起初感觉很奇怪；但是她很快就习惯了
然后像往常一样开始自言自语。“来吧，我有一半的计划
现在完成！这些变化真是令人费解！我永远不确定我是什么
从一分钟到另一分钟！但是，我已经回到我的
合适的尺寸：接下来的事情就是进入那个美丽的花园
我想知道这是要做的事吗？” 正如她所说的那样，她突然来了
在一个空旷的地方，里面有一个大约四英尺高的小房子。
爱丽丝想说：“无论住在那里的人，永远都不会来到他们身上
_this_ size：为什么，我应该吓他们一跳！所以她
又开始again右手，没有冒险去
直到她把自己降到九英寸高为止。




第六章
猪和胡椒


一两分钟，她站着看着房子，想知道是什么
接下来，当穿着制服的男仆突然跑出来
伍德-（她认为他是步兵，因为他身着制服：
否则，仅从他的脸来看，她会称他为
鱼），然后用指关节大声敲门。它由
另一个穿着制服的步兵，圆脸，大眼睛像
青蛙; 爱丽丝（Alice）注意到，两个男仆都有had发
满脑子都是 她很想知道那是什么
大约，从树林里爬了一点​​路来听。

渔民开始从他的胳膊下发出一封伟大的信，
几乎和他一样大，然后他移交给了另一个人，
庄严地说：“为公爵夫人。来自的邀请
女王打槌球。” 青蛙脚夫同样庄严地重复
语调，只是稍微改变了单词的顺序，“来自女王。
邀请公爵夫人打槌球。”

然后他们俩低下了头，卷发纠缠在一起。

爱丽丝对此大笑，以至于她不得不跑回树林
怕他们听到她的声音；当她下次偷看
Fish-Footman走了，另一个坐在附近的地面上
门，愚蠢地凝视着天空。

爱丽丝胆怯地走到门上，敲了敲门。

man夫说：“敲门没有任何用处，
两个原因。首先，因为我和你在门的同一侧
是; 其次，因为他们在内部发出如此大的声音，所以没人能
可能听到你的声音。” 当然，这是最特别的
里面不断传来噪音-持续不断的how叫和打喷嚏
然后发生了严重的车祸，好像碟子或水壶被打破了一样
件。

“那么请，”爱丽丝说，“我要怎么进入？”

“敲门可能有些道理，”步兵继续说道。
不用照顾她，“如果我们之间有门。例如，
如果你是_inside_，你可能会敲门，我可以让你出去，你
知道。” 他一直在说话，一直仰望天空，
这个爱丽丝认为绝对不文明。“但也许他无能为力，”
她对自己说：“他的眼睛非常_非常_接近他的顶部
头。但无论如何，他可能会回答问题。“我该如何进入？”
她大声重复。

步行者说：“我坐在这里，直到明天-”

这时房子的门打开了，大盘子来了
掠过脚步者的脑袋直走：它只是擦过他的鼻子，
在他身后的一棵树上摔成碎片。

“-或者第二天，”步兵正好用同样的语气继续说。
好像什么都没发生。

“我怎么进去？” 爱丽丝再次大声问。

“ _你要进去吗？” 步兵说。“那是第一个
问题，你知道的。”

毫无疑问：只有爱丽丝不喜欢这样被告知。“是真的
她自言自语道，“可怕的是所有这些生物争论的方式。
足以使一个人疯狂！”

步兵似乎认为这是一个重复他的好机会
备注，带有变化。他说：“我会坐在这里，断断续续地，因为
天又一天。”

“但是我该怎么办？” 爱丽丝说。

“随便什么，”步兵说，然后开始吹口哨。

“哦，跟他说话毫无用处，”爱丽丝拼命地说：“他是
太白痴了！” 她打开门走进去。

门直接通向一个大厨房，厨房里到处都是烟
一端到另一端：公爵夫人坐在三腿凳子上
在中间，照顾婴儿；厨师靠在火上，
搅拌一个似乎盛满汤的大锅。

“那汤里肯定有太多胡椒粉！” 爱丽丝对
她自己，也可以打喷嚏。

肯定有太多的空气。连公爵夫人都打喷嚏
偶尔; 至于婴儿，它正在打喷嚏和how叫
交替地没有片刻的停顿。厨房里唯一的东西
没有打喷嚏的是厨师，还有只坐在那里的大猫
在炉膛上，从耳朵到耳朵都笑了。

“请您告诉我，”爱丽丝有些胆怯地说道，因为她当时
不太确定她首先讲话是否礼貌，“为什么
你的猫这样笑吗？”

“是柴郡的猫，”公爵夫人说，“这就是原因。猪！”

她说出最后一句话时，突然感到暴力，爱丽丝十分
跳 但她又看了一眼，这是针对
宝贝，而不是她，所以她鼓起勇气，又继续说：

“我不知道柴郡的猫总是笑嘻嘻；其实我没有
知道猫会咧嘴笑。”

公爵夫人说：“他们都可以。” “而且大部分时间都是。”

“我不知道有什么事，”爱丽丝很客气地说，感觉很
很高兴进行对话。

“你知道的不多，”公爵夫人说。“那是事实。”

爱丽丝根本不喜欢这句话的基调，并认为这样做会
以及介绍其他话题。当她
试图固定一个，厨师从锅里取出汤的大锅
起火，马上开始工作，将一切都扔到
公爵夫人和婴儿-烙铁首先出现；然后跟随
淋浴锅，盘子和盘子。公爵夫人没有注意到
他们，即使他们打她；婴儿已经哭了很多
很难说打击是否伤害了它。

“哦，请介意您在做什么！” 爱丽丝哭了，跳来跳去
在恐怖的痛苦中 “哦，他的鼻子流下来了！” 作为一个
非常大的平底锅飞到它附近，几乎把它抬起来
关。

“如果所有人都介意自己的事，”公爵夫人嘶哑地说。
咆哮着，“世界将比现在更快地达成协议。”

“哪一个不是优势，”爱丽丝很高兴
有机会炫耀她的一点知识。“只是
想一想白天和黑夜会做些什么！你看
地球需要二十四小时才能绕其轴转动—”

“说斧头，”公爵夫人说，“砍下她的头！”

爱丽丝焦急地瞥了一下厨师，看她是否想吃
提示 但是厨师忙着搅拌汤，似乎没有
一直在听，所以她又继续说：“二十四个小时，我想。要么
是十二点吗？一世-”

“哦，别打扰我了，”公爵夫人说。“我永远不会遵守
数据！” 然后她开始再次护理她的孩子，唱歌
像她那样摇篮曲，并猛烈摇晃
每行的结尾：

“和你的小男孩粗话，
    当他打喷嚏时打他：
他只会惹恼他
    因为他知道这很有趣。”


合唱。
（厨师和婴儿加入其中）：


“哇！哇！哇！”


当公爵夫人演唱这首歌的第二节时，她一直在折腾
婴儿剧烈地上下移动，可怜的小东西如此led叫，
爱丽丝几乎听不见以下话：

“我严厉地对我的男孩说话，
    他打喷嚏时我打了他。
因为他可以彻底享受
    他高兴的时候放胡椒粉！”


合唱。


“哇！哇！哇！”


“这里！如果愿意，您可以稍作护理！” 公爵夫人对爱丽丝说，
她说话时把婴儿扑向她。“我必须去准备比赛
与女王打槌球，然后她赶出房间。厨师
她外出时向她扔了一个平底锅，但它想念她。

爱丽丝很奇怪地抓住了婴儿，因为它是一个奇怪的形状
小动物，四肢伸出手脚，
“就像海星一样，”爱丽丝想。可怜的小东西是
当她抓到它时像个蒸汽引擎一样打nor，并不断加倍
自我提升并再次理顺自我，因此，总计
一到两分钟之内，她竭尽所能。

她确定了正确的护理方法后，（
把它扭成一个结，然后紧紧抓住它的右边
耳朵和左脚，以防止其消失。
露天 “如果我不带这个孩子陪我走，”
爱丽丝想，“他们一定会在一两天内杀死它：不是吗？
留下来谋杀？” 她大声说出最后一句话，
小东西在回覆中咕（一声（这回已经打喷嚏了）。
“别咕gr，”爱丽丝说。“那根本不是正确的方式
表达自己。”

婴儿再次咕gr一声，爱丽丝焦急地看着脸
看看有什么问题。毫无疑问，它具有
非常翘鼻，更像是鼻子，而不是真实的鼻子；也
一个婴儿的眼睛变得非常小：爱丽丝一共做了
完全不喜欢它的外观。“但也许仅仅是
抽泣着，”她想着，再次看着它的眼睛，看是否有
有眼泪。

不，没有眼泪。“亲爱的，如果你要变成猪，”
爱丽丝认真地说，“与您无关。心神
现在！” 可怜的小东西再次抽泣（或咕gr，这是不可能的）
说什么），他们沉默了片刻。

爱丽丝刚刚开始对自己说：“现在，我要做什么？
当我回到家的时候，有了这个生物？” 当它再次发出咕unt声时
她猛烈地低头看着它的脸。这次
可能没有错误：它既不大于也不小于
一头猪，她觉得这对她来说很荒谬
进一步。

所以她放下了这个小生物，看到它感到很欣慰。
悄悄溜进树林。“如果它长大了，”她说
她自己，“那会生出一个可怕的丑陋的孩子：但是它使
我认为，这是一头漂亮的猪。” 她开始思考其他
她认识的孩子，可能像猪一样好，只是说
对她自己说：“如果一个人只知道改变它们的正确方法-”
看到柴郡猫坐在树枝上
离几码远的一棵树。

猫只在看到爱丽丝时笑了。她看起来很乖
想到：它仍然有很长的爪子和很多的牙齿，所以她
认为应该予以尊重。

“ Cheshire Puss，”她有点胆怯地开始，因为她根本不知道
是否想要名称：但是，它只笑了一点
更宽的。“来吧，到目前为止很高兴，”爱丽丝想着，然后继续说道。
“你能告诉我，我应该从这走哪条路？”

“这取决于您想去的地方，” Cat说。

“我不在乎-”爱丽丝说。

“那么走哪条路都没关系，”猫说。

“-只要我知道_somewhere_，”爱丽丝补充说。

猫，说：“哦，你一定会那样做的
足够。”

爱丽丝觉得这是不能否认的，所以她尝试了另一个
题。“什么样的人住在这里？”

猫向右挥动着爪子说：“朝那个方向，活着
帽匠：并朝那个方向挥舞着另一只脚掌，
三月野兔。随便你去看看：他们都疯了。”

“但是我不想和疯子呆在一起，”爱丽丝评论道。

“哦，你无能为力，”猫说：“我们都在这里生气。我生气了。
你疯了。”

“你怎么知道我生气了？” 爱丽丝说。

猫说：“你一定是，否则你不会来这里的。”

爱丽丝根本没有证明这一点。但是，她继续说“
你知道你疯了吗？”

猫说：“开始，狗没有生气。你同意吗？”

“我想是的，”爱丽丝说。

“那么，”猫继续说道，“你看，一只狗生气时咆哮着，
并在高兴时摇尾巴。现在，当我高兴时，我咆哮着，
生气时摇尾巴 因此我很生气。”

爱丽丝说：“我叫它叫pur，而不是咆哮。”

“随便叫什么，”猫说。“你用
今天女王吗？”

爱丽丝说：“我非常喜欢它，但是我没有被邀请
然而。”

“你会在那儿看到我的，”猫说，消失了。

爱丽丝对此并不感到惊讶，她已经习惯了
发生的事情。当她看着那里的地方时，
它突然又出现了。

“再见了，那婴儿怎么了？” 猫说。“我差不多
忘了问。”

“它变成了猪，”爱丽丝平静地说，就像它回来了一样。
以自然的方式

“我以为会，”猫说，然后消失了。

爱丽丝稍等了一会儿，一半期望再次看到它，但没有
出现，一两分钟后，她朝
据说三月野兔住在那里。“我以前见过仇恨者，”她
对自己说：“三月野兔将是最有趣的，并且
也许因为这是五月，它不会发疯-至少不会那么发疯
是在三月。” 就像她说的那样，她抬起头，那里是猫
再次，坐在一棵树的树枝上。

“你说的是猪还是无花果？” 猫说。

“我说猪，”爱丽丝回答。“我希望你不会继续出现
突然消失了：你变得头晕目眩。”

“好的，”猫说。这次消失得很慢
从尾巴的末端开始，以笑容结束，
其余的部分消失后仍保留了一段时间。

“好！我经常见到没有笑容的猫。“但是
笑着没有猫！这是我一生中看到的最奇怪的事情！”

在她看到那所房子之前，她还没有走得更远。
三月野兔：她认为这一定是正确的房子，因为
烟囱的形状像耳朵，屋顶是用毛皮盖起来的。它
房子这么大，以至于她不喜欢走近
了一些蘑菇的左手，并提高了自己
到大约两英尺高：即使如此，她还是朝它走去
怯tim地对自己说：“毕竟应该疯了！
我几乎希望我能去见帽匠！”




第七章
疯狂的茶党


房子前面的树下摆着一张桌子。
三月野兔和帽匠正在喝茶：睡鼠坐在
他们之间，快睡着了，另外两个人把它当作
靠垫，将手肘放在上面，并在头顶交谈。“非常
爱丽丝想：“睡鼠不舒服。” “只是，因为它睡着了，
我想这不介意。”

桌子很大，但是三个人挤在一起
它的一个角落：“没有空间！没空间！” 他们看到的时候哭了
爱丽丝来了。“有很多房间！” 爱丽丝愤慨地说，
她坐在桌子一端的一把大扶手椅上。

“喝点酒，”三月野兔鼓舞人心。

爱丽丝四处张望着桌子，但除了茶什么都没有。
她说：“我没看到酒。”

“没有任何东西，”三月野兔说。

“那么，提供它并不是很礼貌，”爱丽丝生气地说道。

“你不被邀请就坐下来并不是很礼貌，”他说
三月野兔。

“我不知道那是你的桌子，”爱丽丝说。“它奠定了一个伟大的
超过三个。”

“你的头发要剪，”帽匠说。他一直在看
爱丽丝好奇地呆了一段时间，这是他的第一个
言语。

“你应该学会不要发表个人言论，”爱丽丝对一些人说。
严重性 “这很不礼貌。”

帽匠听到这个消息就睁大了眼睛。但他说的全部
是，“为什么乌鸦像写字台？”

“来吧，我们现在会很有趣的！” 爱丽丝想。“我很高兴他们已经
她开始大声询问。——我相信我能猜到。”她大声说道。

“您是说您认为自己可以找到答案吗？” 说过
三月野兔。

“是的，”爱丽丝说。

“那你应该说什么意思，”三月野兔继续说道。

“我愿意。”爱丽丝急忙回答。“至少-至少我是说我的意思
说-那是同一回事，你知道的。”

“有点不一样！” 帽匠说。“你可能也一样
说“我看到我吃的东西”与“我看到我吃的东西”是一样的东西！”

三月野兔补充说：“你可能会说，'我喜欢
“我得到”与“我得到我喜欢的东西”一样！”

“也许你也可以这么说，”睡鼠补充说，他似乎
在他的睡眠中说：“我睡觉时呼吸”是一回事
就像“我呼吸时就睡觉”！”

“这与你是同一回事，”帽匠说，在这里
谈话中断，聚会静默了片刻，
爱丽丝想了想她所有关于乌鸦和
写字台，不多。

帽子匠是第一个打破沉默的人。“每月的哪一天
是吗？” 他说，转向爱丽丝：他已经从他的手表中取出了手表。
口袋，不安地看着它，时不时地摇晃着，
并拿到他的耳朵。

爱丽丝考虑了一下，然后说：“第四。”

“两天错了！” 帽匠叹了口气。“我告诉你黄油不适合
作品！” 他生气地看着三月野兔。

“那是最好的黄油，”三月野兔温柔地回答。

“是的，但也一定要塞入一些碎屑，”哈特抱怨道：
“你不应该把它和面包刀放在一起。”

三月野兔拿了手表，阴郁地看着它：然后他蘸了
把它放到他的茶里，然后再次看了看。但是他想到了
没有什么比他的第一句话更好地说了：“那是最好的黄油，
你懂。”

爱丽丝好奇地看着他的肩膀。“真是
有趣的手表！” 她说。“它告诉一个月的某天，而不会
告诉现在几点！”

“为什么要这样？” 帽匠喃喃自语。“您的手表告诉您什么吗？
今年是？

“当然不是，”爱丽丝很容易地回答：“但是那是因为
在一起呆了这么长时间。”

哈特说：“ _ mine_就是这种情况。”

爱丽丝感到非常困惑。帽匠的话似乎没有
有点意思，但肯定是英语。“我不太
懂你的意思。”她尽可能礼貌地说道。

“帽鼠再次入睡，”帽匠说，他倒了一点。
鼻子上有热茶。

睡鼠不耐烦地摇了摇头，说，没有打开它。
眼睛，“当然，当然；就是我要说的话。”

“你猜谜了吗？” 帽匠说，转向爱丽丝
再次。

“不，我放弃了，”爱丽丝回答：“答案是什么？”

哈特说：“我没有丝毫想法。”

“不是我，”三月野兔说。

爱丽丝疲倦地叹了口气。“我认为您可能会在
她说，“比浪费时间去问那些没有的谜语
答案。”

哈特说：“如果你像我一样了解时间，那你就不会说话了。
关于浪费_it_。是他_。”

“我不知道你的意思，”爱丽丝说。

“当然不！” 帽匠说，甩头
轻蔑地 “我敢说你甚至从未和时代说话！”

“也许不是，”爱丽丝谨慎地回答：“但我知道我必须击败
我学习音乐的时间。”

“啊！这就是原因。”帽匠说。“他不会受挫。
现在，如果您只和他保持良好的关系，他几乎会做任何事情
您喜欢时钟。例如，假设现在是九点
早上，只是时间开始上课：您只需要低语
提示时间，并且转瞬即逝！一点半，
吃晚饭了！”

（“我只希望是那样，”三月野兔低声说道。）

爱丽丝若有所思地说：“那肯定是盛大的，但后来-我
你应该不饿。”

帽匠说：“也许一开始不是这样，但你可以把它保留在
只要您喜欢，就可以保留一半的时间。”

“是您管理的方式吗？” 爱丽丝问。

帽匠悲哀地摇了摇头。“不是我！” 他回答。“我们
去年三月吵架，就在他发疯之前，你知道-”（指
带着茶匙在三月野兔，）“ —那是一场很棒的音乐会
由红心皇后奉献，我必须唱歌

“一闪一闪，小蝙蝠！
我真不知道你在做什么！


你知道这首歌吗？”

“我听到过类似的声音，”爱丽丝说。

“继续下去，你知道，”帽匠继续说道，“这样：

“在飞翔的世界之上，
就像天空中的茶盘。
                    一闪一闪-'”


在这里，睡鼠摇了摇头，开始在睡眠中唱歌
“ _眨眼，一闪，一闪，一闪_—”然后持续了很长时间，以至于他们
必须捏住它才能停止。

哈特说：“嗯，我几乎没有完成第一节经文，
皇后跳起来大喊，“他在谋杀时间！和他一起
头！'”

“多么野蛮的人！” 爱丽丝大叫。

“从那以后，”帽匠悲哀地说道，“他不会
做我问的事情！现在总是六点钟。”

一个好主意浮现在爱丽丝的脑海。“是因为原因很多
这里放茶吗？” 她问。

“是的，就是这样，”帽匠叹了口气说：“一直都是下午茶时间，
而且我们之间没有时间洗东西了。”

“那我想你要继续走动吗？” 爱丽丝说。

哈特说：“的确如此，因为东西用完了。”

“但是当您再次开始时会发生什么？” 爱丽丝冒险
问。

“假设我们改变话题，”三月野兔打着哈欠打断道。
“我对此感到厌倦。我投票说小姐告诉我们一个故事。”

“我怕我不认识，”爱丽丝说。
提案。

“那睡鼠就要！” 他们都哭了。“醒来，睡鼠！” 和
他们立刻把它捏在两边。

睡鼠慢慢睁开眼睛。“我没有睡着，”他在
嘶哑，微弱的声音：“我听到了你们每个人说的每句话。”

“告诉我们一个故事！” 三月野兔说。

“是的，请这样做！” 恳求爱丽丝。

帽匠补充说：“快点吧，否则您将再次入睡。
在完成之前。”

“从前有三个小姐妹，”睡鼠开始
急切地 “他们的名字叫Elsie，Lacie和Tillie；和
他们住在井的底部，”

“他们以什么为生？” 爱丽丝说，他一直很感兴趣
关于饮食问题。

睡鼠思考了一会或
二。

“你做不到，你知道的，”爱丽丝温柔地说。
“他们病了。”

“就是这样，”睡鼠说。“_病得很重。”

爱丽丝试图幻想自己如此非同寻常的方式
生活会很像，但是这让她很困惑，于是她继续说：“但是
为什么他们住在井底？”

三月野兔非常认真地对爱丽丝说：“多喝点茶。”

“我还什么都没有，”爱丽丝生气地说，“所以我不能
多拿一些。”

帽匠说：“你的意思是说你不能_less_，这很容易
多拿不多。”

“没有人问您的意见，”爱丽丝说。

“谁在发表个人言论？” 帽匠胜利地问。

爱丽丝不知道该说些什么：于是她帮助自己
一些茶和面包和黄油，然后转向睡鼠，
重复了她的问题。“为什么他们住在井底？”

睡鼠又花了一两分钟考虑一下，然后
说，“那是一口井井。”

“没有这样的东西！” 爱丽丝起初非常生气，但是
帽匠和游行野兔去了“嘘！嘘！” 和睡鼠生闷气
说道：“如果你不能做礼貌的人，那么最好为
你自己。”

“不，请继续！” 爱丽丝很谦卑地说。“我不会再打扰了。一世
敢说可能有一个。”

“一个，的确如此！” 睡鼠愤怒地说道。但是，他同意
继续。“所以这三个小姐妹-他们正在学习绘画，
你懂-”

“他们画了什么？” 爱丽丝说，完全忘记了自己的诺言。

“龟，”睡鼠说，没有一直在考虑。

“我想要一个干净的杯子，”帽匠打断道：“让我们一起移动一个地方。
上。”

他说话的时候继续前进，睡鼠跟着他：三月野兔
搬到了睡鼠的地方，而爱丽丝不情愿地接过了
三月野兔的地方。帽子匠是唯一得到任何东西的人
改变带来的好处：而且爱丽丝的处境比
以前，就像三月野兔刚把牛奶罐倒进盘子里一样。

爱丽丝不想再次冒犯睡鼠，所以她开始
谨慎地说道：“但我不明白。他们在哪里画龙骨
从？”

帽匠说：“你可以从水井里抽水。” “所以我应该
认为您可以将糖蜜从糖蜜井中抽出来，是吗，愚蠢？”

“但是他们在井里，”爱丽丝对睡鼠说，没有选择
注意这最后一句话。

“他们当然是，”睡鼠说。“-进来。”

这个答案让可怜的爱丽丝感到困惑，以至于让睡鼠继续
一段时间不打断它。

“他们正在学习绘画，”睡鼠继续打着哈欠，揉着揉搓。
它的眼睛，因为它已经很困了。“他们吸引了各种
事物-以M开头的所有事物-”

“为什么要带M？” 爱丽丝说。

“为什么不？” 三月野兔说。

爱丽丝沉默了。

这次睡鼠闭上了眼睛，即将进入
瞌睡; 但是，在被帽匠捏住之后，它又被唤醒了
有点尖叫，然后继续：“-以M开头，例如
捕鼠器，月亮，记忆和许多东西–你知道你说
事情“很多” —您是否曾经看到过这样的事情？
画很多？”

“真的，现在您问我，”爱丽丝很困惑地说道，“我不
认为-”

“那你不应该说话，”帽匠说。

这种粗鲁的行为超出了爱丽丝所能承受的范围：她站起来
非常厌恶，走开了；睡鼠立刻就睡着了，
尽管她没有其他人对她的去处感到最少
回头一两次，希望他们能跟着她打电话：
她最后一次见到他们时，他们正试图将睡鼠放入
茶壶。

“无论如何，我再也不会去那里了！” 爱丽丝接她时说
穿过树林。“这是我参加过的最愚蠢的茶话会
我的一生！”

就像她说的那样，她注意到其中一棵树有一扇门
带领它进入。“这很好奇！” 她想。“但
今天一切都很好奇。我想我最好还是马上进去。” 和
在她去了。

她再次发现自己在长长的大厅里，靠近小男孩。
玻璃桌子。她说：“现在，这次我会做得更好。”
然后开始用小金钥匙，然后打开那扇门
带入花园。然后她去上班ni蘑菇
（她已经将它的一部分放在口袋里了）直到大约一英尺
高：然后她沿着小通道走了；然后，她发现了
自己终于在美丽的花园中，在明亮的花坛中
还有凉爽的喷泉




第八章
女王的槌球地面


一棵大玫瑰树站在花园入口附近：玫瑰
上面长着白色，但是忙着三个园丁
把它们涂成红色。爱丽丝觉得这很奇怪，她
走近看他们，就在她走近他们时，她听到了
其中一个说：“请注意，五个！不要把油漆泼在我身上
像那样！”

“我无能为力。”五人闷闷不乐地说。“七点慢跑我的
弯头。”

七个在上面抬头说：“是的，五个！总是躺在
怪别人！”

“ _你最好不要说话！” 五说。“我听说女王只说
昨天你应该被斩首！”

“做什么的？” 先说的那个人说。

“那不关你的事，两个！” 七说。

“是的，这是他的事！” 五口说：“我告诉他-那是为了
带上郁金香的根而不是洋葱。”

七个扔掉了他的画笔，刚开始说“嗯，所有不公正的人
事情-”当他的眼睛有机会落在爱丽丝身上时，她站着看着
他们，他突然检查自己：其他人也环顾四周，
他们都低下了头。

“您能告诉我吗，”爱丽丝有些胆怯地说道，“为什么
画那些玫瑰？”

五点和七点什么也没说，但看着二点。两人从低处开始
声音，“为什么事实如此，小姐，这在这里应该是
红色的玫瑰树，我们误把白色的树放进去了。如果女王
是要找到答案，我们都应该切断头脑，你知道的。所以
你看，小姐，在她来之前，我们正在竭尽全力-”
焦急地看着花园对面的时刻五，
出“女王！皇后！” 然后三个园丁立刻扔了
自己平放在脸上。有很多脚步声，
爱丽丝转过身，急切地想见女王。

首先是十名携带俱乐部的士兵。这些都像
三个长方形和扁平的园丁，手脚放在
角落：接下来的十位朝臣；这些都装饰着
钻石，然后像士兵一样走了两个和两个。这些来之后
王室的孩子们；他们有十个人，小宝贝们来了
夫妻在一起时快乐地跳着：他们都是
用心点缀。接下来是客人，主要是国王和皇后，
爱丽丝（Alice）认出了白兔（White Rabbit）：
匆忙地紧张起来，对所说的一切微笑着，然后去了
通过不注意她。然后跟随心K
深红色天鹅绒坐垫上的国王的王冠；最后，这一切
盛大的游行，就是“国王与皇后”。

爱丽丝很怀疑她是否应该不躺下
像三个园丁一样，但她不记得曾经听过
游行中的这种规则；“此外，
她想，“游行，如果人们都必须躺下
脸，让他们看不到？” 所以她站在那里
等一下

当游行队伍与爱丽丝相对时，他们都停下来看着
女王对她严厉地说：“这是谁？” 她对
心之痛，只是低下头，微笑着回应。

“白痴！” 女王说，不耐烦地把头扔了。然后，转向
爱丽丝，她继续说：“孩子，你叫什么名字？”

“我叫爱丽丝，请please下。”爱丽丝很客气地说。
但她对自己说：“为什么，它们只是一副纸牌
所有。我不必害怕他们！”

皇后指着三位园丁说：“这些是谁？”
谁躺在玫瑰树上；因为，你看，因为他们躺在
他们的脸，背上的图案与其他人的一样
包里，她不知道他们是园丁还是士兵，
或朝臣，或她自己的三个孩子。

“我应该怎么知道？” 爱丽丝对自己的勇气感到惊讶。“它的
不关我的事。”

女王怒不可遏地变成了深红色，瞪了她一眼。
像野兽一样的瞬间，尖叫着“抬起头！关-”

“废话！” 爱丽丝大声而坚定地说，女王是
无声。

国王将手放在她的手臂上，胆怯地说：“考虑一下，我的
亲爱的：她只是个孩子！

女王生气地转身离开他，对to夫说：“转身
他们过去了！”

Knave用一只脚非常小心地这样做。

“起床！” 女王用一种尖锐而响亮的声音说，这三个
园丁们立即跳起来，开始向国王，女王鞠躬，
王室的孩子们，以及其他所有人。

“别说了！” 女王大叫。“你让我头晕。” 然后，
转向玫瑰树时，她继续说道：“你在做什么？
这里？”

“请您Ma下。”二人谦虚地说。
他跪下来说：“我们正在努力-”

“_我懂了！” 女王说，他一直在检查玫瑰。
“开着头！” 游行队伍继续前进，其中三个
剩下的士兵处决了不幸的园丁，他们跑了
向爱丽丝寻求保护。

“你不会被斩首！” 爱丽丝说，她把它们放在一个大的
站在附近的花盆。三名士兵四处游荡
一两分钟，寻找它们，然后在
其他。

“他们的头掉了吗？” 女王喊了。

“如果请s下，他们的头不见了！” 士兵大喊
回复。

“那就对了！” 女王喊了。“你会打槌球吗？”

士兵们保持沉默，看着爱丽丝，因为问题是
显然对她意味着。

“是！” 爱丽丝大喊。

“那就来！” 女王大吼，爱丽丝参加了游行，
非常想知道接下来会发生什么。

“那是-这是非常美好的一天！” 她那边怯tim的声音说。她曾经是
走过焦急地窥视着她的白兔子。

“很好，”爱丽丝说：“-公爵夫人在哪里？”

“嘘！嘘！兔子低沉而仓促地说道。他看了
他说话时焦急地捂在肩膀上，然后站起来
to起脚尖，将他的嘴靠近她的耳朵，小声说：“她在
执行判决。”

“做什么的？” 爱丽丝说。

“你说'真可惜！'？” 兔子问。

“不，我没有，”爱丽丝说：“我不认为这很可惜。我说
'做什么的？'”

“She boxed the Queen’s ears—” the Rabbit began. Alice gave a little
scream of laughter. “Oh, hush!” the Rabbit whispered in a frightened
tone. “The Queen will hear you! You see, she came rather late, and the
Queen said—”

“Get to your places!” shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder, and
people began running about in all directions, tumbling up against each
other; however, they got settled down in a minute or two, and the game
began. Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground
in her life; it was all ridges and furrows; the balls were live
hedgehogs, the mallets live flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double
themselves up and to stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.

The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her flamingo:
she succeeded in getting its body tucked away, comfortably enough,
under her arm, with its legs hanging down, but generally, just as she
had got its neck nicely straightened out, and was going to give the
hedgehog a blow with its head, it _would_ twist itself round and look
up in her face, with such a puzzled expression that she could not help
bursting out laughing: and when she had got its head down, and was
going to begin again, it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog
had unrolled itself, and was in the act of crawling away: besides all
this, there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she
wanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers were
always getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground, Alice
soon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed.

The players all played at once without waiting for turns, quarrelling
all the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short time
the Queen was in a furious passion, and went stamping about, and
shouting “Off with his head!” or “Off with her head!” about once in a
minute.

Alice began to feel very uneasy: to be sure, she had not as yet had any
dispute with the Queen, but she knew that it might happen any minute,
“and then,” thought she, “what would become of me? They’re dreadfully
fond of beheading people here; the great wonder is, that there’s any
one left alive!”

She was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering whether she
could get away without being seen, when she noticed a curious
appearance in the air: it puzzled her very much at first, but, after
watching it a minute or two, she made it out to be a grin, and she said
to herself “It’s the Cheshire Cat: now I shall have somebody to talk
to.”

“How are you getting on?” said the Cat, as soon as there was mouth
enough for it to speak with.

Alice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded. “It’s no use
speaking to it,” she thought, “till its ears have come, or at least one
of them.” In another minute the whole head appeared, and then Alice put
down her flamingo, and began an account of the game, feeling very glad
she had someone to listen to her. The Cat seemed to think that there
was enough of it now in sight, and no more of it appeared.

“I don’t think they play at all fairly,” Alice began, in rather a
complaining tone, “and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can’t hear
oneself speak—and they don’t seem to have any rules in particular; at
least, if there are, nobody attends to them—and you’ve no idea how
confusing it is all the things being alive; for instance, there’s the
arch I’ve got to go through next walking about at the other end of the
ground—and I should have croqueted the Queen’s hedgehog just now, only
it ran away when it saw mine coming!”

“How do you like the Queen?” said the Cat in a low voice.

“Not at all,” said Alice: “she’s so extremely—” Just then she noticed
that the Queen was close behind her, listening: so she went on,
“—likely to win, that it’s hardly worth while finishing the game.”

The Queen smiled and passed on.

“Who _are_ you talking to?” said the King, going up to Alice, and
looking at the Cat’s head with great curiosity.

“It’s a friend of mine—a Cheshire Cat,” said Alice: “allow me to
introduce it.”

“I don’t like the look of it at all,” said the King: “however, it may
kiss my hand if it likes.”

“I’d rather not,” the Cat remarked.

“Don’t be impertinent,” said the King, “and don’t look at me like
that!” He got behind Alice as he spoke.

“A cat may look at a king,” said Alice. “I’ve read that in some book,
but I don’t remember where.”

“Well, it must be removed,” said the King very decidedly, and he called
the Queen, who was passing at the moment, “My dear! I wish you would
have this cat removed!”

The Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great or
small. “Off with his head!” she said, without even looking round.

“I’ll fetch the executioner myself,” said the King eagerly, and he
hurried off.

Alice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game was going
on, as she heard the Queen’s voice in the distance, screaming with
passion. She had already heard her sentence three of the players to be
executed for having missed their turns, and she did not like the look
of things at all, as the game was in such confusion that she never knew
whether it was her turn or not. So she went in search of her hedgehog.

The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, which seemed
to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the
other: the only difficulty was, that her flamingo was gone across to
the other side of the garden, where Alice could see it trying in a
helpless sort of way to fly up into a tree.

By the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back, the fight
was over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight: “but it doesn’t
matter much,” thought Alice, “as all the arches are gone from this side
of the ground.” So she tucked it away under her arm, that it might not
escape again, and went back for a little more conversation with her
friend.

When she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to find quite
a large crowd collected round it: there was a dispute going on between
the executioner, the King, and the Queen, who were all talking at once,
while all the rest were quite silent, and looked very uncomfortable.

The moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to settle
the question, and they repeated their arguments to her, though, as they
all spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly
what they said.

The executioner’s argument was, that you couldn’t cut off a head unless
there was a body to cut it off from: that he had never had to do such a
thing before, and he wasn’t going to begin at _his_ time of life.

The King’s argument was, that anything that had a head could be
beheaded, and that you weren’t to talk nonsense.

The Queen’s argument was, that if something wasn’t done about it in
less than no time she’d have everybody executed, all round. (It was
this last remark that had made the whole party look so grave and
anxious.)

Alice could think of nothing else to say but “It belongs to the
Duchess: you’d better ask _her_ about it.”

“She’s in prison,” the Queen said to the executioner: “fetch her here.”
And the executioner went off like an arrow.

The Cat’s head began fading away the moment he was gone, and, by the
time he had come back with the Duchess, it had entirely disappeared; so
the King and the executioner ran wildly up and down looking for it,
while the rest of the party went back to the game.




CHAPTER IX.
The Mock Turtle’s Story


“You can’t think how glad I am to see you again, you dear old thing!”
said the Duchess, as she tucked her arm affectionately into Alice’s,
and they walked off together.

Alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper, and thought
to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her so
savage when they met in the kitchen.

“When _I’m_ a Duchess,” she said to herself, (not in a very hopeful
tone though), “I won’t have any pepper in my kitchen _at all_. Soup
does very well without—Maybe it’s always pepper that makes people
hot-tempered,” she went on, very much pleased at having found out a new
kind of rule, “and vinegar that makes them sour—and camomile that makes
them bitter—and—and barley-sugar and such things that make children
sweet-tempered. I only wish people knew _that_: then they wouldn’t be
so stingy about it, you know—”

She had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a little
startled when she heard her voice close to her ear. “You’re thinking
about something, my dear, and that makes you forget to talk. I can’t
tell you just now what the moral of that is, but I shall remember it in
a bit.”

“Perhaps it hasn’t one,” Alice ventured to remark.

“Tut, tut, child!” said the Duchess. “Everything’s got a moral, if only
you can find it.” And she squeezed herself up closer to Alice’s side as
she spoke.

Alice did not much like keeping so close to her: first, because the
Duchess was _very_ ugly; and secondly, because she was exactly the
right height to rest her chin upon Alice’s shoulder, and it was an
uncomfortably sharp chin. However, she did not like to be rude, so she
bore it as well as she could.

“The game’s going on rather better now,” she said, by way of keeping up
the conversation a little.

“’Tis so,” said the Duchess: “and the moral of that is—‘Oh, ’tis love,
’tis love, that makes the world go round!’”

“Somebody said,” Alice whispered, “that it’s done by everybody minding
their own business!”

“Ah, well! It means much the same thing,” said the Duchess, digging her
sharp little chin into Alice’s shoulder as she added, “and the moral of
_that_ is—‘Take care of the sense, and the sounds will take care of
themselves.’”

“How fond she is of finding morals in things!” Alice thought to
herself.

“I dare say you’re wondering why I don’t put my arm round your waist,”
the Duchess said after a pause: “the reason is, that I’m doubtful about
the temper of your flamingo. Shall I try the experiment?”

“He might bite,” Alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all anxious
to have the experiment tried.

“Very true,” said the Duchess: “flamingoes and mustard both bite. And
the moral of that is—‘Birds of a feather flock together.’”

“Only mustard isn’t a bird,” Alice remarked.

“Right, as usual,” said the Duchess: “what a clear way you have of
putting things!”

“It’s a mineral, I _think_,” said Alice.

“Of course it is,” said the Duchess, who seemed ready to agree to
everything that Alice said; “there’s a large mustard-mine near here.
And the moral of that is—‘The more there is of mine, the less there is
of yours.’”

“Oh, I know!” exclaimed Alice, who had not attended to this last
remark, “it’s a vegetable. It doesn’t look like one, but it is.”

“I quite agree with you,” said the Duchess; “and the moral of that
is—‘Be what you would seem to be’—or if you’d like it put more
simply—‘Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might
appear to others that what you were or might have been was not
otherwise than what you had been would have appeared to them to be
otherwise.’”

“I think I should understand that better,” Alice said very politely,
“if I had it written down: but I can’t quite follow it as you say it.”

“That’s nothing to what I could say if I chose,” the Duchess replied,
in a pleased tone.

“Pray don’t trouble yourself to say it any longer than that,” said
Alice.

“Oh, don’t talk about trouble!” said the Duchess. “I make you a present
of everything I’ve said as yet.”

“A cheap sort of present!” thought Alice. “I’m glad they don’t give
birthday presents like that!” But she did not venture to say it out
loud.

“Thinking again?” the Duchess asked, with another dig of her sharp
little chin.

“I’ve a right to think,” said Alice sharply, for she was beginning to
feel a little worried.

“Just about as much right,” said the Duchess, “as pigs have to fly; and
the m—”

But here, to Alice’s great surprise, the Duchess’s voice died away,
even in the middle of her favourite word ‘moral,’ and the arm that was
linked into hers began to tremble. Alice looked up, and there stood the
Queen in front of them, with her arms folded, frowning like a
thunderstorm.

“A fine day, your Majesty!” the Duchess began in a low, weak voice.

“Now, I give you fair warning,” shouted the Queen, stamping on the
ground as she spoke; “either you or your head must be off, and that in
about half no time! Take your choice!”

The Duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment.

“Let’s go on with the game,” the Queen said to Alice; and Alice was too
much frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her back to the
croquet-ground.

The other guests had taken advantage of the Queen’s absence, and were
resting in the shade: however, the moment they saw her, they hurried
back to the game, the Queen merely remarking that a moment’s delay
would cost them their lives.

All the time they were playing the Queen never left off quarrelling
with the other players, and shouting “Off with his head!” or “Off with
her head!” Those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the
soldiers, who of course had to leave off being arches to do this, so
that by the end of half an hour or so there were no arches left, and
all the players, except the King, the Queen, and Alice, were in custody
and under sentence of execution.

Then the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to Alice, “Have
you seen the Mock Turtle yet?”

“No,” said Alice. “I don’t even know what a Mock Turtle is.”

“It’s the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from,” said the Queen.

“I never saw one, or heard of one,” said Alice.

“Come on, then,” said the Queen, “and he shall tell you his history,”

As they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a low voice,
to the company generally, “You are all pardoned.” “Come, _that’s_ a
good thing!” she said to herself, for she had felt quite unhappy at the
number of executions the Queen had ordered.

They very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the sun. (If
you don’t know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture.) “Up, lazy
thing!” said the Queen, “and take this young lady to see the Mock
Turtle, and to hear his history. I must go back and see after some
executions I have ordered;” and she walked off, leaving Alice alone
with the Gryphon. Alice did not quite like the look of the creature,
but on the whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it
as to go after that savage Queen: so she waited.

The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched the Queen till
she was out of sight: then it chuckled. “What fun!” said the Gryphon,
half to itself, half to Alice.

“What _is_ the fun?” said Alice.

“Why, _she_,” said the Gryphon. “It’s all her fancy, that: they never
executes nobody, you know. Come on!”

“Everybody says ‘come on!’ here,” thought Alice, as she went slowly
after it: “I never was so ordered about in all my life, never!”

They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the distance,
sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and, as they came
nearer, Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break. She
pitied him deeply. “What is his sorrow?” she asked the Gryphon, and the
Gryphon answered, very nearly in the same words as before, “It’s all
his fancy, that: he hasn’t got no sorrow, you know. Come on!”

So they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with large eyes
full of tears, but said nothing.

“This here young lady,” said the Gryphon, “she wants for to know your
history, she do.”

“I’ll tell it her,” said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow tone: “sit
down, both of you, and don’t speak a word till I’ve finished.”

So they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes. Alice thought to
herself, “I don’t see how he can _ever_ finish, if he doesn’t begin.”
But she waited patiently.

“Once,” said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, “I was a real
Turtle.”

These words were followed by a very long silence, broken only by an
occasional exclamation of “Hjckrrh!” from the Gryphon, and the constant
heavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle. Alice was very nearly getting up and
saying, “Thank you, sir, for your interesting story,” but she could not
help thinking there _must_ be more to come, so she sat still and said
nothing.

“When we were little,” the Mock Turtle went on at last, more calmly,
though still sobbing a little now and then, “we went to school in the
sea. The master was an old Turtle—we used to call him Tortoise—”

“Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn’t one?” Alice asked.

“We called him Tortoise because he taught us,” said the Mock Turtle
angrily: “really you are very dull!”

“You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple
question,” added the Gryphon; and then they both sat silent and looked
at poor Alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth. At last the
Gryphon said to the Mock Turtle, “Drive on, old fellow! Don’t be all
day about it!” and he went on in these words:

“Yes, we went to school in the sea, though you mayn’t believe it—”

“I never said I didn’t!” interrupted Alice.

“You did,” said the Mock Turtle.

“Hold your tongue!” added the Gryphon, before Alice could speak again.
The Mock Turtle went on.

“We had the best of educations—in fact, we went to school every day—”

“_I’ve_ been to a day-school, too,” said Alice; “you needn’t be so
proud as all that.”

“With extras?” asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously.

“Yes,” said Alice, “we learned French and music.”

“And washing?” said the Mock Turtle.

“Certainly not!” said Alice indignantly.

“Ah! then yours wasn’t a really good school,” said the Mock Turtle in a
tone of great relief. “Now at _ours_ they had at the end of the bill,
‘French, music, _and washing_—extra.’”

“You couldn’t have wanted it much,” said Alice; “living at the bottom
of the sea.”

“I couldn’t afford to learn it.” said the Mock Turtle with a sigh. “I
only took the regular course.”

“What was that?” inquired Alice.

“Reeling and Writhing, of course, to begin with,” the Mock Turtle
replied; “and then the different branches of Arithmetic—Ambition,
Distraction, Uglification, and Derision.”

“I never heard of ‘Uglification,’” Alice ventured to say. “What is it?”

The Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise. “What! Never heard of
uglifying!” it exclaimed. “You know what to beautify is, I suppose?”

“Yes,” said Alice doubtfully: “it means—to—make—anything—prettier.”

“Well, then,” the Gryphon went on, “if you don’t know what to uglify
is, you _are_ a simpleton.”

Alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it, so
she turned to the Mock Turtle, and said “What else had you to learn?”

“Well, there was Mystery,” the Mock Turtle replied, counting off the
subjects on his flappers, “—Mystery, ancient and modern, with
Seaography: then Drawling—the Drawling-master was an old conger-eel,
that used to come once a week: _he_ taught us Drawling, Stretching, and
Fainting in Coils.”

“What was _that_ like?” said Alice.

“Well, I can’t show it you myself,” the Mock Turtle said: “I’m too
stiff. And the Gryphon never learnt it.”

“Hadn’t time,” said the Gryphon: “I went to the Classics master,
though. He was an old crab, _he_ was.”

“I never went to him,” the Mock Turtle said with a sigh: “he taught
Laughing and Grief, they used to say.”

“So he did, so he did,” said the Gryphon, sighing in his turn; and both
creatures hid their faces in their paws.

“And how many hours a day did you do lessons?” said Alice, in a hurry
to change the subject.

“Ten hours the first day,” said the Mock Turtle: “nine the next, and so
on.”

“What a curious plan!” exclaimed Alice.

“That’s the reason they’re called lessons,” the Gryphon remarked:
“because they lessen from day to day.”

This was quite a new idea to Alice, and she thought it over a little
before she made her next remark. “Then the eleventh day must have been
a holiday?”

“Of course it was,” said the Mock Turtle.

“And how did you manage on the twelfth?” Alice went on eagerly.

“That’s enough about lessons,” the Gryphon interrupted in a very
decided tone: “tell her something about the games now.”




CHAPTER X.
The Lobster Quadrille


The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and drew the back of one flapper across
his eyes. He looked at Alice, and tried to speak, but for a minute or
two sobs choked his voice. “Same as if he had a bone in his throat,”
said the Gryphon: and it set to work shaking him and punching him in
the back. At last the Mock Turtle recovered his voice, and, with tears
running down his cheeks, he went on again:—

“You may not have lived much under the sea—” (“I haven’t,” said
Alice)—“and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster—”
(Alice began to say “I once tasted—” but checked herself hastily, and
said “No, never”) “—so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a
Lobster Quadrille is!”

“No, indeed,” said Alice. “What sort of a dance is it?”

“Why,” said the Gryphon, “you first form into a line along the
sea-shore—”

“Two lines!” cried the Mock Turtle. “Seals, turtles, salmon, and so on;
then, when you’ve cleared all the jelly-fish out of the way—”

“_That_ generally takes some time,” interrupted the Gryphon.

“—you advance twice—”

“Each with a lobster as a partner!” cried the Gryphon.

“Of course,” the Mock Turtle said: “advance twice, set to partners—”

“—change lobsters, and retire in same order,” continued the Gryphon.

“Then, you know,” the Mock Turtle went on, “you throw the—”

“The lobsters!” shouted the Gryphon, with a bound into the air.

“—as far out to sea as you can—”

“Swim after them!” screamed the Gryphon.

“Turn a somersault in the sea!” cried the Mock Turtle, capering wildly
about.

“Change lobsters again!” yelled the Gryphon at the top of its voice.

“Back to land again, and that’s all the first figure,” said the Mock
Turtle, suddenly dropping his voice; and the two creatures, who had
been jumping about like mad things all this time, sat down again very
sadly and quietly, and looked at Alice.

“It must be a very pretty dance,” said Alice timidly.

“Would you like to see a little of it?” said the Mock Turtle.

“Very much indeed,” said Alice.

“Come, let’s try the first figure!” said the Mock Turtle to the
Gryphon. “We can do without lobsters, you know. Which shall sing?”

“Oh, _you_ sing,” said the Gryphon. “I’ve forgotten the words.”

So they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice, every now and
then treading on her toes when they passed too close, and waving their
forepaws to mark the time, while the Mock Turtle sang this, very slowly
and sadly:—

“Will you walk a little faster?” said a whiting to a snail.
“There’s a porpoise close behind us, and he’s treading on my tail.
See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance!
They are waiting on the shingle—will you come and join the dance?
Will you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, will you join the dance?
Will you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, won’t you join the dance?

“You can really have no notion how delightful it will be
When they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to sea!”
But the snail replied “Too far, too far!” and gave a look askance—
Said he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join the dance.
Would not, could not, would not, could not, would not join the dance.
Would not, could not, would not, could not, could not join the dance.

“What matters it how far we go?” his scaly friend replied.
“There is another shore, you know, upon the other side.
The further off from England the nearer is to France—
Then turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and join the dance.
Will you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, will you join the dance?
Will you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, won’t you join the dance?”


“Thank you, it’s a very interesting dance to watch,” said Alice,
feeling very glad that it was over at last: “and I do so like that
curious song about the whiting!”

“Oh, as to the whiting,” said the Mock Turtle, “they—you’ve seen them,
of course?”

“Yes,” said Alice, “I’ve often seen them at dinn—” she checked herself
hastily.

“I don’t know where Dinn may be,” said the Mock Turtle, “but if you’ve
seen them so often, of course you know what they’re like.”

“I believe so,” Alice replied thoughtfully. “They have their tails in
their mouths—and they’re all over crumbs.”

“You’re wrong about the crumbs,” said the Mock Turtle: “crumbs would
all wash off in the sea. But they _have_ their tails in their mouths;
and the reason is—” here the Mock Turtle yawned and shut his
eyes.—“Tell her about the reason and all that,” he said to the Gryphon.

“The reason is,” said the Gryphon, “that they _would_ go with the
lobsters to the dance. So they got thrown out to sea. So they had to
fall a long way. So they got their tails fast in their mouths. So they
couldn’t get them out again. That’s all.”

“Thank you,” said Alice, “it’s very interesting. I never knew so much
about a whiting before.”

“I can tell you more than that, if you like,” said the Gryphon. “Do you
know why it’s called a whiting?”

“I never thought about it,” said Alice. “Why?”

“_It does the boots and shoes_,” the Gryphon replied very solemnly.

Alice was thoroughly puzzled. “Does the boots and shoes!” she repeated
in a wondering tone.

“Why, what are _your_ shoes done with?” said the Gryphon. “I mean, what
makes them so shiny?”

Alice looked down at them, and considered a little before she gave her
answer. “They’re done with blacking, I believe.”

“Boots and shoes under the sea,” the Gryphon went on in a deep voice,
“are done with a whiting. Now you know.”

“And what are they made of?” Alice asked in a tone of great curiosity.

“Soles and eels, of course,” the Gryphon replied rather impatiently:
“any shrimp could have told you that.”

“If I’d been the whiting,” said Alice, whose thoughts were still
running on the song, “I’d have said to the porpoise, ‘Keep back,
please: we don’t want _you_ with us!’”

“They were obliged to have him with them,” the Mock Turtle said: “no
wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise.”

“Wouldn’t it really?” said Alice in a tone of great surprise.

“Of course not,” said the Mock Turtle: “why, if a fish came to _me_,
and told me he was going a journey, I should say ‘With what porpoise?’”

“Don’t you mean ‘purpose’?” said Alice.

“I mean what I say,” the Mock Turtle replied in an offended tone. And
the Gryphon added “Come, let’s hear some of _your_ adventures.”

“I could tell you my adventures—beginning from this morning,” said
Alice a little timidly: “but it’s no use going back to yesterday,
because I was a different person then.”

“Explain all that,” said the Mock Turtle.

“No, no! The adventures first,” said the Gryphon in an impatient tone:
“explanations take such a dreadful time.”

So Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first
saw the White Rabbit. She was a little nervous about it just at first,
the two creatures got so close to her, one on each side, and opened
their eyes and mouths so _very_ wide, but she gained courage as she
went on. Her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part
about her repeating “_You are old, Father William_,” to the
Caterpillar, and the words all coming different, and then the Mock
Turtle drew a long breath, and said “That’s very curious.”

“It’s all about as curious as it can be,” said the Gryphon.

“It all came different!” the Mock Turtle repeated thoughtfully. “I
should like to hear her try and repeat something now. Tell her to
begin.” He looked at the Gryphon as if he thought it had some kind of
authority over Alice.

“Stand up and repeat ‘’_Tis the voice of the sluggard_,’” said the
Gryphon.

“How the creatures order one about, and make one repeat lessons!”
thought Alice; “I might as well be at school at once.” However, she got
up, and began to repeat it, but her head was so full of the Lobster
Quadrille, that she hardly knew what she was saying, and the words came
very queer indeed:—

“’Tis the voice of the Lobster; I heard him declare,
“You have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair.”
As a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose
Trims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes.”

[later editions continued as follows
When the sands are all dry, he is gay as a lark,
And will talk in contemptuous tones of the Shark,
But, when the tide rises and sharks are around,
His voice has a timid and tremulous sound.]


“That’s different from what _I_ used to say when I was a child,” said
the Gryphon.

“Well, I never heard it before,” said the Mock Turtle; “but it sounds
uncommon nonsense.”

Alice said nothing; she had sat down with her face in her hands,
wondering if anything would _ever_ happen in a natural way again.

“I should like to have it explained,” said the Mock Turtle.

“She can’t explain it,” said the Gryphon hastily. “Go on with the next
verse.”

“But about his toes?” the Mock Turtle persisted. “How _could_ he turn
them out with his nose, you know?”

“It’s the first position in dancing.” Alice said; but was dreadfully
puzzled by the whole thing, and longed to change the subject.

“Go on with the next verse,” the Gryphon repeated impatiently: “it
begins ‘_I passed by his garden_.’”

Alice did not dare to disobey, though she felt sure it would all come
wrong, and she went on in a trembling voice:—

“I passed by his garden, and marked, with one eye,
How the Owl and the Panther were sharing a pie—”

[later editions continued as follows
The Panther took pie-crust, and gravy, and meat,
While the Owl had the dish as its share of the treat.
When the pie was all finished, the Owl, as a boon,
Was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon:
While the Panther received knife and fork with a growl,
And concluded the banquet—]


“What _is_ the use of repeating all that stuff,” the Mock Turtle
interrupted, “if you don’t explain it as you go on? It’s by far the
most confusing thing _I_ ever heard!”

“Yes, I think you’d better leave off,” said the Gryphon: and Alice was
only too glad to do so.

“Shall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille?” the Gryphon
went on. “Or would you like the Mock Turtle to sing you a song?”

“Oh, a song, please, if the Mock Turtle would be so kind,” Alice
replied, so eagerly that the Gryphon said, in a rather offended tone,
“Hm! No accounting for tastes! Sing her ‘_Turtle Soup_,’ will you, old
fellow?”

The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and began, in a voice sometimes choked
with sobs, to sing this:—

“Beautiful Soup, so rich and green,
Waiting in a hot tureen!
Who for such dainties would not stoop?
Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!
Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!
    Beau—ootiful Soo—oop!
    Beau—ootiful Soo—oop!
Soo—oop of the e—e—evening,
    Beautiful, beautiful Soup!

“Beautiful Soup! Who cares for fish,
Game, or any other dish?
Who would not give all else for two p
ennyworth only of beautiful Soup?
Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup?
    Beau—ootiful Soo—oop!
    Beau—ootiful Soo—oop!
Soo—oop of the e—e—evening,
    Beautiful, beauti—FUL SOUP!”


“Chorus again!” cried the Gryphon, and the Mock Turtle had just begun
to repeat it, when a cry of “The trial’s beginning!” was heard in the
distance.

“Come on!” cried the Gryphon, and, taking Alice by the hand, it hurried
off, without waiting for the end of the song.

“What trial is it?” Alice panted as she ran; but the Gryphon only
answered “Come on!” and ran the faster, while more and more faintly
came, carried on the breeze that followed them, the melancholy words:—

“Soo—oop of the e—e—evening,
    Beautiful, beautiful Soup!”




CHAPTER XI.
Who Stole the Tarts?


The King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when they
arrived, with a great crowd assembled about them—all sorts of little
birds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards: the Knave was
standing before them, in chains, with a soldier on each side to guard
him; and near the King was the White Rabbit, with a trumpet in one
hand, and a scroll of parchment in the other. In the very middle of the
court was a table, with a large dish of tarts upon it: they looked so
good, that it made Alice quite hungry to look at them—“I wish they’d
get the trial done,” she thought, “and hand round the refreshments!”
But there seemed to be no chance of this, so she began looking at
everything about her, to pass away the time.

Alice had never been in a court of justice before, but she had read
about them in books, and she was quite pleased to find that she knew
the name of nearly everything there. “That’s the judge,” she said to
herself, “because of his great wig.”

The judge, by the way, was the King; and as he wore his crown over the
wig, (look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he did it,) he
did not look at all comfortable, and it was certainly not becoming.

“And that’s the jury-box,” thought Alice, “and those twelve creatures,”
(she was obliged to say “creatures,” you see, because some of them were
animals, and some were birds,) “I suppose they are the jurors.” She
said this last word two or three times over to herself, being rather
proud of it: for she thought, and rightly too, that very few little
girls of her age knew the meaning of it at all. However, “jury-men”
would have done just as well.

The twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates. “What are
they doing?” Alice whispered to the Gryphon. “They can’t have anything
to put down yet, before the trial’s begun.”

“They’re putting down their names,” the Gryphon whispered in reply,
“for fear they should forget them before the end of the trial.”

“Stupid things!” Alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but she
stopped hastily, for the White Rabbit cried out, “Silence in the
court!” and the King put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round,
to make out who was talking.

Alice could see, as well as if she were looking over their shoulders,
that all the jurors were writing down “stupid things!” on their slates,
and she could even make out that one of them didn’t know how to spell
“stupid,” and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him. “A nice
muddle their slates’ll be in before the trial’s over!” thought Alice.

One of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked. This of course, Alice
could _not_ stand, and she went round the court and got behind him, and
very soon found an opportunity of taking it away. She did it so quickly
that the poor little juror (it was Bill, the Lizard) could not make out
at all what had become of it; so, after hunting all about for it, he
was obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day; and this
was of very little use, as it left no mark on the slate.

“Herald, read the accusation!” said the King.

On this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and then
unrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows:—

“The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts,
    All on a summer day:
The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts,
    And took them quite away!”


“Consider your verdict,” the King said to the jury.

“Not yet, not yet!” the Rabbit hastily interrupted. “There’s a great
deal to come before that!”

“Call the first witness,” said the King; and the White Rabbit blew
three blasts on the trumpet, and called out, “First witness!”

The first witness was the Hatter. He came in with a teacup in one hand
and a piece of bread-and-butter in the other. “I beg pardon, your
Majesty,” he began, “for bringing these in: but I hadn’t quite finished
my tea when I was sent for.”

“You ought to have finished,” said the King. “When did you begin?”

The Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into the
court, arm-in-arm with the Dormouse. “Fourteenth of March, I _think_ it
was,” he said.

“Fifteenth,” said the March Hare.

“Sixteenth,” added the Dormouse.

“Write that down,” the King said to the jury, and the jury eagerly
wrote down all three dates on their slates, and then added them up, and
reduced the answer to shillings and pence.

“Take off your hat,” the King said to the Hatter.

“It isn’t mine,” said the Hatter.

“_Stolen!_” the King exclaimed, turning to the jury, who instantly made
a memorandum of the fact.

“I keep them to sell,” the Hatter added as an explanation; “I’ve none
of my own. I’m a hatter.”

Here the Queen put on her spectacles, and began staring at the Hatter,
who turned pale and fidgeted.

“Give your evidence,” said the King; “and don’t be nervous, or I’ll
have you executed on the spot.”

This did not seem to encourage the witness at all: he kept shifting
from one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the Queen, and in his
confusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the
bread-and-butter.

Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which puzzled
her a good deal until she made out what it was: she was beginning to
grow larger again, and she thought at first she would get up and leave
the court; but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was
as long as there was room for her.

“I wish you wouldn’t squeeze so.” said the Dormouse, who was sitting
next to her. “I can hardly breathe.”

“I can’t help it,” said Alice very meekly: “I’m growing.”

“You’ve no right to grow _here_,” said the Dormouse.

“Don’t talk nonsense,” said Alice more boldly: “you know you’re growing
too.”

“Yes, but _I_ grow at a reasonable pace,” said the Dormouse: “not in
that ridiculous fashion.” And he got up very sulkily and crossed over
to the other side of the court.

All this time the Queen had never left off staring at the Hatter, and,
just as the Dormouse crossed the court, she said to one of the officers
of the court, “Bring me the list of the singers in the last concert!”
on which the wretched Hatter trembled so, that he shook both his shoes
off.

“Give your evidence,” the King repeated angrily, “or I’ll have you
executed, whether you’re nervous or not.”

“I’m a poor man, your Majesty,” the Hatter began, in a trembling voice,
“—and I hadn’t begun my tea—not above a week or so—and what with the
bread-and-butter getting so thin—and the twinkling of the tea—”

“The twinkling of the _what?_” said the King.

“It _began_ with the tea,” the Hatter replied.

“Of course twinkling begins with a T!” said the King sharply. “Do you
take me for a dunce? Go on!”

“I’m a poor man,” the Hatter went on, “and most things twinkled after
that—only the March Hare said—”

“I didn’t!” the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry.

“You did!” said the Hatter.

“I deny it!” said the March Hare.

“He denies it,” said the King: “leave out that part.”

“Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said—” the Hatter went on, looking
anxiously round to see if he would deny it too: but the Dormouse denied
nothing, being fast asleep.

“After that,” continued the Hatter, “I cut some more bread-and-butter—”

“But what did the Dormouse say?” one of the jury asked.

“That I can’t remember,” said the Hatter.

“You _must_ remember,” remarked the King, “or I’ll have you executed.”

The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter, and went
down on one knee. “I’m a poor man, your Majesty,” he began.

“You’re a _very_ poor _speaker_,” said the King.

Here one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately suppressed by
the officers of the court. (As that is rather a hard word, I will just
explain to you how it was done. They had a large canvas bag, which tied
up at the mouth with strings: into this they slipped the guinea-pig,
head first, and then sat upon it.)

“I’m glad I’ve seen that done,” thought Alice. “I’ve so often read in
the newspapers, at the end of trials, “There was some attempts at
applause, which was immediately suppressed by the officers of the
court,” and I never understood what it meant till now.”

“If that’s all you know about it, you may stand down,” continued the
King.

“I can’t go no lower,” said the Hatter: “I’m on the floor, as it is.”

“Then you may _sit_ down,” the King replied.

Here the other guinea-pig cheered, and was suppressed.

“Come, that finished the guinea-pigs!” thought Alice. “Now we shall get
on better.”

“I’d rather finish my tea,” said the Hatter, with an anxious look at
the Queen, who was reading the list of singers.

“You may go,” said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the court,
without even waiting to put his shoes on.

“—and just take his head off outside,” the Queen added to one of the
officers: but the Hatter was out of sight before the officer could get
to the door.

“Call the next witness!” said the King.

The next witness was the Duchess’s cook. She carried the pepper-box in
her hand, and Alice guessed who it was, even before she got into the
court, by the way the people near the door began sneezing all at once.

“Give your evidence,” said the King.

“Shan’t,” said the cook.

The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said in a low voice,
“Your Majesty must cross-examine _this_ witness.”

“Well, if I must, I must,” the King said, with a melancholy air, and,
after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till his eyes were
nearly out of sight, he said in a deep voice, “What are tarts made of?”

“Pepper, mostly,” said the cook.

“Treacle,” said a sleepy voice behind her.

“Collar that Dormouse,” the Queen shrieked out. “Behead that Dormouse!
Turn that Dormouse out of court! Suppress him! Pinch him! Off with his
whiskers!”

For some minutes the whole court was in confusion, getting the Dormouse
turned out, and, by the time they had settled down again, the cook had
disappeared.

“Never mind!” said the King, with an air of great relief. “Call the
next witness.” And he added in an undertone to the Queen, “Really, my
dear, _you_ must cross-examine the next witness. It quite makes my
forehead ache!”

Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list, feeling
very curious to see what the next witness would be like, “—for they
haven’t got much evidence _yet_,” she said to herself. Imagine her
surprise, when the White Rabbit read out, at the top of his shrill
little voice, the name “Alice!”




CHAPTER XII.
Alice’s Evidence


“Here!” cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment how
large she had grown in the last few minutes, and she jumped up in such
a hurry that she tipped over the jury-box with the edge of her skirt,
upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below, and there
they lay sprawling about, reminding her very much of a globe of
goldfish she had accidentally upset the week before.

“Oh, I _beg_ your pardon!” she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay, and
began picking them up again as quickly as she could, for the accident
of the goldfish kept running in her head, and she had a vague sort of
idea that they must be collected at once and put back into the
jury-box, or they would die.

“The trial cannot proceed,” said the King in a very grave voice, “until
all the jurymen are back in their proper places—_all_,” he repeated
with great emphasis, looking hard at Alice as he said so.

Alice looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she had put
the Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing was waving its
tail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable to move. She soon
got it out again, and put it right; “not that it signifies much,” she
said to herself; “I should think it would be _quite_ as much use in the
trial one way up as the other.”

As soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being
upset, and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to
them, they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the
accident, all except the Lizard, who seemed too much overcome to do
anything but sit with its mouth open, gazing up into the roof of the
court.

“What do you know about this business?” the King said to Alice.

“Nothing,” said Alice.

“Nothing _whatever?_” persisted the King.

“Nothing whatever,” said Alice.

“That’s very important,” the King said, turning to the jury. They were
just beginning to write this down on their slates, when the White
Rabbit interrupted: “_Un_important, your Majesty means, of course,” he
said in a very respectful tone, but frowning and making faces at him as
he spoke.

“_Un_important, of course, I meant,” the King hastily said, and went on
to himself in an undertone,

“important—unimportant—unimportant—important—” as if he were trying
which word sounded best.

Some of the jury wrote it down “important,” and some “unimportant.”
Alice could see this, as she was near enough to look over their slates;
“but it doesn’t matter a bit,” she thought to herself.

At this moment the King, who had been for some time busily writing in
his note-book, cackled out “Silence!” and read out from his book, “Rule
Forty-two. _All persons more than a mile high to leave the court_.”

Everybody looked at Alice.

“_I’m_ not a mile high,” said Alice.

“You are,” said the King.

“Nearly two miles high,” added the Queen.

“Well, I shan’t go, at any rate,” said Alice: “besides, that’s not a
regular rule: you invented it just now.”

“It’s the oldest rule in the book,” said the King.

“Then it ought to be Number One,” said Alice.

The King turned pale, and shut his note-book hastily. “Consider your
verdict,” he said to the jury, in a low, trembling voice.

“There’s more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty,” said the
White Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry; “this paper has just been
picked up.”

“What’s in it?” said the Queen.

“I haven’t opened it yet,” said the White Rabbit, “but it seems to be a
letter, written by the prisoner to—to somebody.”

“It must have been that,” said the King, “unless it was written to
nobody, which isn’t usual, you know.”

“Who is it directed to?” said one of the jurymen.

“It isn’t directed at all,” said the White Rabbit; “in fact, there’s
nothing written on the _outside_.” He unfolded the paper as he spoke,
and added “It isn’t a letter, after all: it’s a set of verses.”

“Are they in the prisoner’s handwriting?” asked another of the jurymen.

“No, they’re not,” said the White Rabbit, “and that’s the queerest
thing about it.” (The jury all looked puzzled.)

“He must have imitated somebody else’s hand,” said the King. (The jury
all brightened up again.)

“Please your Majesty,” said the Knave, “I didn’t write it, and they
can’t prove I did: there’s no name signed at the end.”

“If you didn’t sign it,” said the King, “that only makes the matter
worse. You _must_ have meant some mischief, or else you’d have signed
your name like an honest man.”

There was a general clapping of hands at this: it was the first really
clever thing the King had said that day.

“That _proves_ his guilt,” said the Queen.

“It proves nothing of the sort!” said Alice. “Why, you don’t even know
what they’re about!”

“Read them,” said the King.

The White Rabbit put on his spectacles. “Where shall I begin, please
your Majesty?” he asked.

“Begin at the beginning,” the King said gravely, “and go on till you
come to the end: then stop.”

These were the verses the White Rabbit read:—

“They told me you had been to her,
    And mentioned me to him:
She gave me a good character,
    But said I could not swim.

He sent them word I had not gone
    (We know it to be true):
If she should push the matter on,
    What would become of you?

I gave her one, they gave him two,
    You gave us three or more;
They all returned from him to you,
    Though they were mine before.

If I or she should chance to be
    Involved in this affair,
He trusts to you to set them free,
    Exactly as we were.

My notion was that you had been
    (Before she had this fit)
An obstacle that came between
    Him, and ourselves, and it.

Don’t let him know she liked them best,
    For this must ever be
A secret, kept from all the rest,
    Between yourself and me.”


“That’s the most important piece of evidence we’ve heard yet,” said the
King, rubbing his hands; “so now let the jury—”

“If any one of them can explain it,” said Alice, (she had grown so
large in the last few minutes that she wasn’t a bit afraid of
interrupting him,) “I’ll give him sixpence. _I_ don’t believe there’s
an atom of meaning in it.”

The jury all wrote down on their slates, “_She_ doesn’t believe there’s
an atom of meaning in it,” but none of them attempted to explain the
paper.

“If there’s no meaning in it,” said the King, “that saves a world of
trouble, you know, as we needn’t try to find any. And yet I don’t
know,” he went on, spreading out the verses on his knee, and looking at
them with one eye; “I seem to see some meaning in them, after all.
“—_said I could not swim_—” you can’t swim, can you?” he added, turning
to the Knave.

The Knave shook his head sadly. “Do I look like it?” he said. (Which he
certainly did _not_, being made entirely of cardboard.)

“All right, so far,” said the King, and he went on muttering over the
verses to himself: “‘_We know it to be true_—’ that’s the jury, of
course—‘_I gave her one, they gave him two_—’ why, that must be what he
did with the tarts, you know—”

“But, it goes on ‘_they all returned from him to you_,’” said Alice.

“Why, there they are!” said the King triumphantly, pointing to the
tarts on the table. “Nothing can be clearer than _that_. Then
again—‘_before she had this fit_—’ you never had fits, my dear, I
think?” he said to the Queen.

“Never!” said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the Lizard
as she spoke. (The unfortunate little Bill had left off writing on his
slate with one finger, as he found it made no mark; but he now hastily
began again, using the ink, that was trickling down his face, as long
as it lasted.)

“Then the words don’t _fit_ you,” said the King, looking round the
court with a smile. There was a dead silence.

“It’s a pun!” the King added in an offended tone, and everybody
laughed, “Let the jury consider their verdict,” the King said, for
about the twentieth time that day.

“No, no!” said the Queen. “Sentence first—verdict afterwards.”

“Stuff and nonsense!” said Alice loudly. “The idea of having the
sentence first!”

“Hold your tongue!” said the Queen, turning purple.

“I won’t!” said Alice.

“Off with her head!” the Queen shouted at the top of her voice. Nobody
moved.

“Who cares for you?” said Alice, (she had grown to her full size by
this time.) “You’re nothing but a pack of cards!”

At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down upon
her: she gave a little scream, half of fright and half of anger, and
tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with her
head in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some dead
leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face.

“Wake up, Alice dear!” said her sister; “Why, what a long sleep you’ve
had!”

“Oh, I’ve had such a curious dream!” said Alice, and she told her
sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange
Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and when she
had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, “It _was_ a curious
dream, dear, certainly: but now run in to your tea; it’s getting late.”
So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she ran, as well she might,
what a wonderful dream it had been.


But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her head on her
hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of little Alice and all
her wonderful Adventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion,
and this was her dream:—

First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the tiny
hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes were
looking up into hers—she could hear the very tones of her voice, and
see that queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair
that _would_ always get into her eyes—and still as she listened, or
seemed to listen, the whole place around her became alive with the
strange creatures of her little sister’s dream.

The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried by—the
frightened Mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool—she
could hear the rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and his friends
shared their never-ending meal, and the shrill voice of the Queen
ordering off her unfortunate guests to execution—once more the pig-baby
was sneezing on the Duchess’s knee, while plates and dishes crashed
around it—once more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the
Lizard’s slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,
filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable Mock
Turtle.

So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in
Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and all
would change to dull reality—the grass would be only rustling in the
wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds—the rattling
teacups would change to tinkling sheep-bells, and the Queen’s shrill
cries to the voice of the shepherd boy—and the sneeze of the baby, the
shriek of the Gryphon, and all the other queer noises, would change
(she knew) to the confused clamour of the busy farm-yard—while the
lowing of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock
Turtle’s heavy sobs.

Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers
would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how she would
keep, through all her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her
childhood: and how she would gather about her other little children,
and make _their_ eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale,
perhaps even with the dream of Wonderland of long ago: and how she
would feel with all their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all
their simple joys, remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer
days.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
